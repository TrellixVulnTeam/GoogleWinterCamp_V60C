you do n't want to be here .	Lisa Simpson
neither do you !	Lisa Simpson
mom , how could you pay someone to be my friend ? !	Lisa Simpson
answer me !	Lisa Simpson
i would n't say i paid someone to be your friend . i just gave her money for records and ice cream .	Marge Simpson
you gave away ice cream ? !	Homer Simpson
i would 've found a friend eventually . you could n't wait a damn decade until i got into college ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa . lisa , wait ...	Marge Simpson
oh god , oh god , i 'm the smart parent .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry she rejected your `` i 'm sorry , '' cake , but in a way , i 'm not . i guess what i 'm trying to say is i like cake .	Homer Simpson
no . i think i went too far .	Marge Simpson
is that the boy you named me after ?	Homer Simpson
you pay lenny and carl to be my friends ?	Homer Simpson
hm . well , that makes me feel better .	Marge Simpson
lisa 's door 's unlocked !	Marge Simpson
dad , is that story really true ?	Homer Simpson
lisa , just say something to me .	Marge Simpson
i 'm gon na tell every psychiatrist i ever go to what you did .	Lisa Simpson
a mother 's greatest fear .	Marge Simpson
mom , stop ! stop ! stop ! i 'm sorry !	Lisa Simpson
please stop !	Lisa Simpson
you 're not mad anymore ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm fine . fine ! it 's funny , but ... hurting your feelings made me feel better .	Lisa Simpson
try to forget that .	Marge Simpson
but when i grow up , i 'll find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever . and i 'll always love you .	Lisa Simpson
awww .	Marge Simpson
happy mother 's day .	Lisa Simpson
mother 's day ? !	Bart Simpson
crap !	Homer Simpson
great ! but from now on , we have to be totally honest with each other .	Lisa Simpson
our lord , buddha , says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear .	Lisa Simpson
my brother is about to meet fear , and as usual , he wo n't pass .	Lisa Simpson
wake up , lis ! it 's the last day of school !	Bart Simpson
wake up , maggs ! it 's the last day of school !	Bart Simpson
last day of scho-ol ! last day of scho-ol ! found my summer hob-by ! banging pots togeth-er !	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , marge . as a favor to you , i 'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp .	Homer Simpson
that 's a prison road crew .	Marge Simpson
i did that last summer . i 'm not allowed back .	Bart Simpson
goodbye forever , multiplication !	Bart Simpson
needs more numerators .	Homer Simpson
ah , july fourth -- no fireworks ? ! ca n't this stupid city entertain me one night a year ?	Homer Simpson
the city 's broke . the fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza .	Marge Simpson
marge , when you 're broke , that 's when you 've got to keep up appearances . the fourth of july is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top , and leans into america 's car window . god bless her .	Homer Simpson
the last day of school . field day . when you learn to balance an egg on a spoon ...	Lisa Simpson
and run with your leg tied to someone who would n't talk to you all year .	Lisa Simpson
hey ! are you coming to the afterschool pool party ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's good .	Bart Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
bart faced a terrible choice : take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward . and like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw , bart chose `` b . ''	Lisa Simpson
bart won a blue ribbon ... but was it worth it ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa ! bath time !	Marge Simpson
mom ! i 'm narrating !	Lisa Simpson
the water 's gon na get cold !	Marge Simpson
fine .	Lisa Simpson
as the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through bart 's shirt and into its housing , the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods .	Lisa Simpson
why am i having nightmares ? i 'm no coward .	Bart Simpson
a chicken feather ? why would you hand this to me ? oh , you must 've figured out i chickened out during the race ! well who are you to judge me ? !	Bart Simpson
i suck ? ! you suck !	Bart Simpson
while bart was being outwitted by a baby , something was coming to a boil in our pop 's brainpan .	Lisa Simpson
marge , if this stupid , one-reactor town wo n't put on a fireworks show , i will . i 've mapped it out .	Homer Simpson
maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard .	Marge Simpson
i 've had my problems with sparklers .	Homer Simpson
fourth of july fireworks were a different story . they meant more to my dad than my mom could ever know .	Lisa Simpson
it was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue . he figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did .	Lisa Simpson
with his mom gone , homer needed a hero . and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls .	Lisa Simpson
now let 's see ... which pants have that card ? board shorts , interested shorts , here we are .	Homer Simpson
kaboom .	Homer Simpson
giuseppe , i want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career .	Homer Simpson
if the expendables movies have taught us anything , it 's that people do their best work after they 're old and forgotten .	Homer Simpson
hey buddy .	Bart Simpson
i brought you a cake . read it .	Bart Simpson
um ... that 's kind of a baby show .	Bart Simpson
why would a kitten marry a crocodile ? would n't it eat her ?	Bart Simpson
no ! turn it off ! it 's too intense for me !	Bart Simpson
hey everyone . i sure got a lot of attention for winning this year 's race around the school .	Bart Simpson
yeah , yeah . thank you , mel . but i am not here to talk about myself . milhouse , would you join me at the podium ?	Bart Simpson
i 've got ta set things straight . during that same race , my friend milhouse was in the lead , when something horrible happened ...	Bart Simpson
bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie , and that 's exactly what he did .	Lisa Simpson
rather than try to figure out what happened , milhouse had the courage to move on . to me , that 's a hero .	Bart Simpson
so bart was revealed as a coward , and now it seemed like the whole world was against him .	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
grampa , everyone 's callin ' me a coward .	Bart Simpson
come on . you were in world war two .	Bart Simpson
but do n't people hate cowards ?	Bart Simpson
wow , that sounds pretty sweet .	Bart Simpson
yes .	Bart Simpson
i understand . you have standards .	Bart Simpson
while bart was in hell , homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone .	Lisa Simpson
okay . let 's make some fireworks .	Homer Simpson
oh thank god . a rickety bridge .	Homer Simpson
can i pitch something ?	Homer Simpson
my boy 's having a bad night . we should get the show on the road .	Homer Simpson
come on . let 's go . i ca n't stand to see my family unhappy on america 's holiest day .	Homer Simpson
hey , super mario . do n't you tell me about america !	Homer Simpson
no , you 're a-wrong !	Homer Simpson
who the hell is that ? !	Homer Simpson
milhouse ! this is my chance to make things right !	Bart Simpson
get on that bus ! i 'll explain during the explosions !	Bart Simpson
... saw everything you did ! milhouse is the hero ! take it from me , the boy who 's lied throughout !	Bart Simpson
so milhouse got the redemption he deserved ... and so , in a way , did bart .	Lisa Simpson
which meant that at long last , my brother could get a good night 's sleep .	Lisa Simpson
look , maggie . i undid my deed . so i 'm just gon na take your feather and say goodnight .	Bart Simpson
where are these coming from ?	Bart Simpson
ohhh . i see -- that 's all you wanted .	Bart Simpson
how 's that , kiddo ?	Bart Simpson
sometimes when we touch	Homer Simpson
one more year , tops .	Homer Simpson
then burn on you , 'cause you 'll be holding onto a dead guy !	Homer Simpson
believe me , if you 're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy , fear is not gon na be your problem .	Homer Simpson
it 's a song ? i thought we were just riffing .	Homer Simpson
i do n't !	Homer Simpson
usher ! will you stop that person who 's shushing ? !	Homer Simpson
three feet , nine inches . that should do it .	Lisa Simpson
do n't you know what kind of animal we 're dealing with ?	Bart Simpson
okay , enough theory .	Lisa Simpson
hey , dad ! we made popcorn !	Bart Simpson
out of my reach ? must ... make ... effort ...	Homer Simpson
what 's on tv ?	Homer Simpson
krusty 's getting roasted tonight .	Lisa Simpson
sometimes the language on these gets a little b-l-u-e .	Marge Simpson
if you do n't let us watch , we 'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will .	Lisa Simpson
how permissive ?	Marge Simpson
chief wiggum shows us crime photos at sleepovers .	Bart Simpson
krusty , sorry about the roast . they had no right to say those hilarious things .	Bart Simpson
krusty , why do n't you talk to your dad ? he 'll cheer you up . he 's a rabbi . he must 've learned something from that giant star scroll he 's always reading .	Bart Simpson
well no ... but he 's not a rabbi . more of a flabbi .	Bart Simpson
why you little ! i 'll show you who 's a flabbi !	Homer Simpson
all right , you 're not a flabbi ! okay ! i got it !	Bart Simpson
all muscle . in minnesota i 'd be a supermodel !	Homer Simpson
no , no , it 's a big thing .	Marge Simpson
yes , son . we can .	Homer Simpson
homer , get up !	Marge Simpson
huh ? oh .	Homer Simpson
dad , are you okay ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , yeah , great . i guess my getting-up days are over .	Homer Simpson
dad , you 're eating too much ! i 'm worried about your health ! i do n't wan na lose you !	Lisa Simpson
oh no .	Lisa Simpson
krusty , i brought some homemade chicken soup . we used the play-doh maker for the matzo .	Marge Simpson
but you wear that little spoon around your neck .	Marge Simpson
yes . and i can tell how hard it was to lose your father . but at least you were there to share his final thoughts .	Marge Simpson
well ... it could be worse .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know . uh ... how about ... that 's a lot worse !	Marge Simpson
mom ? dad ?	Lisa Simpson
yes , lisa ?	Marge Simpson
i 've been listening , and dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes . mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him ?	Lisa Simpson
sweetie , you should n't have to worry about such things .	Marge Simpson
the doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep . go to bed . i 'll take care of him .	Marge Simpson
/ no good , no good . what do i do ? what do i do ?	Marge Simpson
/ oh ! breathe , homie , breathe !	Marge Simpson
i 'm gon na prove you did groundbreaking work . krusty , i want you to binge-watch all the shows you 've ever done .	Bart Simpson
hey , krusty .	Bart Simpson
yeah . and i 've learned that all religions are equally boring . but there 's a reason i went . come and see .	Bart Simpson
who 's a hooker ?	Bart Simpson
lisa , what are you doing ?	Homer Simpson
wrapping you in bubble wrap . i ca n't always be around to protect you , so it will .	Lisa Simpson
but ...	Homer Simpson
oh lisa , honey , you ca n't insulate yourself from life . why i could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow . that 's why i never plan more than four seconds ahead .	Homer Simpson
i guess you 're right .	Lisa Simpson
now come on , give daddy a hug .	Homer Simpson
bubble wrap !	Homer Simpson
your daughterly love saved me , sweetie !	Homer Simpson
that 's all i wanted : a tiny bit of control .	Lisa Simpson
me neither .	Homer Simpson
rabbi rudenstein . your father 's favorite .	Bart Simpson
yeah , i guess he just hated your delivery .	Bart Simpson
well , it was n't easy , but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet .	Bart Simpson
i guess there 's nothing left to do but go outside and play . wait , a sponsored link !	Bart Simpson
brief nudityyy !	Homer Simpson
i thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers .	Homer Simpson
i do n't know what that stuff blocks .	Bart Simpson
mammogram appointment .	Marge Simpson
i told you to clean your room and instead you 're watching chest videos ! look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal !	Homer Simpson
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .	Bart Simpson
i know how cereal works . now clean your room .	Homer Simpson
why should i ? it 's just gon na get dirty again .	Bart Simpson
i 'm in charge . you do what i say .	Homer Simpson
i 'll get to it when i get to it .	Bart Simpson
that better not mean what it means when i say it .	Homer Simpson
maybe you two are more similar than you 'd like to admit .	Marge Simpson
we 're not similar . i love being told what to do by someone who 's wise in the ways of the world ! love it !	Homer Simpson
here 's what i would do ... in the middle of the night , clean bart 's room for him , then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room .	Marge Simpson
you poor woman . dealing with bart has turned your mind to ketchup water . you rest . i 'll be the boy 's father now .	Homer Simpson
hm , i 'm not feelin ' it .	Bart Simpson
why do i need to eat broccoli ?	Bart Simpson
look , i 'll drink another glass of milk .	Bart Simpson
milk . that 's for babies and old guys who ca n't sleep at night because of what they did in the war . broccoli .	Homer Simpson
oh it !	Marge Simpson
you are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli . and i 'm going to sit right here until you do .	Homer Simpson
pfft . you 'll never out-sit me .	Bart Simpson
the sit is on .	Bart Simpson
eat your broccoli .	Homer Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
eat your broccoli .	Homer Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
they 've been at it all night .	Marge Simpson
i know , but they 're not gon na waste a whole saturday inside .	Lisa Simpson
today 's our draft ! i 've got to pick a good fantasy team ! when i lost last year they made me do something so humiliating ...	Homer Simpson
jebus loves tebow .	Homer Simpson
and so ... the fat man caves . if you need me , i 'll be up in my room eating cereal . half a bowl of cereal .	Bart Simpson
marge , i want you , my wife , to draft my fantasy football team .	Homer Simpson
i -- i do n't really know that much about --	Marge Simpson
now i am never eating that broccoli .	Bart Simpson
this has got to stop ! if you do n't go to work you 're going to get fired !	Marge Simpson
i can get another job ! who would n't want to hire a man who wo n't back down ? i could be a prison warden or a southern anything .	Homer Simpson
i 've got an idea ... but i 'll need that broccoli .	Lisa Simpson
these two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same . one of them , however , has the broccoli blended in .	Lisa Simpson
bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli , maybe he did n't . no one knows , so neither of you has given in , and this horrible impasse can come to an end .	Lisa Simpson
uh , works for me .	Homer Simpson
i 'm in .	Bart Simpson
oh , thank god .	Marge Simpson
oh no , the broccoli !	Bart Simpson
you did that on purpose ! you lick this table clean !	Homer Simpson
come on . lick it !	Homer Simpson
c'mon , lick it !	Homer Simpson
you can still lick it !	Homer Simpson
i 'm afraid homer and bart 's problems are beyond our power to solve .	Marge Simpson
there 's only one thing left to try .	Marge Simpson
where are we ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't know . eat your broccoli .	Homer Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
we 're on an old-time boat !	Homer Simpson
we 've been kidnapped !	Bart Simpson
relation ship . it works two ways . pretty good . pret-ty good .	Homer Simpson
hey lame ass . thanks to you , we 're stuck on a stupid therapy boat .	Bart Simpson
i 'm the lame ass ? the only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses .	Homer Simpson
now can we respect each other ?	Bart Simpson
ooo , i 'm getting a message from your father 's fantasy football league . i must still be logged in as him .	Marge Simpson
lenny used the uck-word !	Marge Simpson
mom , it 's trash talk . you know how guys say mean things to their friends , the way women say nice things to their enemies .	Lisa Simpson
ohh .	Marge Simpson
yikes !	Marge Simpson
well i do n't like this trash talk . and i 'm gon na do something about it . even if i have to bring in the big guns .	Marge Simpson
dear lord , please help homer 's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean .	Marge Simpson
it 's everywhere .	Marge Simpson
the wi-fi ! the wi-fi ! i 've got to take out the wi-fi !	Marge Simpson
she 's under a lot of stress . her husband 's at sea .	Lisa Simpson
what does that mean ?	Bart Simpson
sheep shank , bowline , clove hitch ...	Bart Simpson
dad , look ! i did a round turn with two half hitches .	Bart Simpson
wait a minute ... windswept hair , rugged tan , rough , calloused hands . you 're enjoying this , are n't you ?	Homer Simpson
so what if i am ?	Bart Simpson
you 're my son and you will hate what i hate . angled parking . lemons . kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money . and this boat !	Homer Simpson
i 'm old enough to choose my own things to hate . and the things i like ! and i like being a sailor .	Bart Simpson
betrayed by my worst enemy . i never would have seen it coming .	Homer Simpson
just like you taught me , captain . over , under , over , under , over , under , under , under , over , over , over , over , over , over , over , under , over , half hitch .	Bart Simpson
i finally got over my sea sickness .	Homer Simpson
i hate the golden age of sail .	Homer Simpson
fine . i 'll swab whatever you say . look , i 'm swabbing the deck . i 'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of . oh ! i 'm swabbing the top of the ocean .	Homer Simpson
ooo ! swab , swab , swab --	Homer Simpson
what the ?	Homer Simpson
fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster !	Homer Simpson
then that 's what i 'm gon na do .	Marge Simpson
lakwando 's mind wo n't be on the game . aaaand benched .	Marge Simpson
and now to make my big move .	Marge Simpson
yi-yo-yu !	Bart Simpson
i love this boat , with all its pullies and flappies and ... everything has a name .	Homer Simpson
yeah ...	Homer Simpson

dad ! we can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse !	Bart Simpson
are you crazy ? we 'll never make it ! drop the anchor and wait out the storm !	Homer Simpson
no , we need to sail !	Bart Simpson
i 'm dropping the anchor !	Homer Simpson

aye-aye , sir .	Homer Simpson

i got a bad sunburn and i was crapped on by a seagull / i do n't see any lifeboats and i do n't think that is legal	Homer Simpson
way heal away ! / we 'll heal away joe !	Homer Simpson
hey ! i was listenin ' to that !	Homer Simpson

my one weakness : the third `` really . '' come with me .	Homer Simpson
but that 's so many sandwiches !	Marge Simpson
turn right here . i keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power .	Homer Simpson
seriously , i am getting so tired of those stupid flandersisms .	Homer Simpson

it 's all gon na thaw !	Homer Simpson
do n't you give up on me !	Homer Simpson
i 'll cook this meat , cut it up , and make it into sandwiches .	Marge Simpson
and i will wait and worry !	Homer Simpson

kids love 'em . we trade them at school .	Lisa Simpson
they replaced cigarettes as our currency .	Bart Simpson
bubble gum cigarettes ?	Marge Simpson

homie ! our prayers have been answered !	Marge Simpson
keep your pants on , marge . it 's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through `` book fairs '' and `` silent auctions . '' and parents get twenty emails a day from the school , and everyone hits `` reply all '' to everything !	Homer Simpson
dad , it 's not a private school . it 's free .	Bart Simpson

hm , oh honey , one teensy problem with this plan . i 'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children . you know , their lungs are so teensy .	Homer Simpson
he has a point ...	Marge Simpson
you know what ? i trust them not to smoke .	Marge Simpson
and if you trust them , i trust them too .	Homer Simpson
safety first .	Homer Simpson
bad news , bears . forecast calls for nothing but rain .	Homer Simpson
if you fall asleep with them , will you even burn to death ?	Homer Simpson
ha ! i gotcha !	Homer Simpson
you ca n't resist smoking in the house any more than i can resist drinking in the car .	Homer Simpson
what happened ?	Marge Simpson
and now i banish you from paradise ! i 'm glad i never bothered to learn which one of you is which .	Homer Simpson
i know just the place .	Homer Simpson

sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , cute ! this one ...	Lisa Simpson
oh man , he made us watch him dance for three hours . and he really only has one move .	Bart Simpson
if someone was fracking in our neighborhood , would n't we know it ?	Marge Simpson
maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue .	Lisa Simpson
this is clearly a fracking site . how are they keeping people away ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's a terrific sport that --	Lisa Simpson
shhh !	Bart Simpson
this whole building is just a faã§ade for a drilling operation .	Lisa Simpson
stopping mr. burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on `` beezus and ramona . '' but i know someone who can help ...	Lisa Simpson
the first female speaker of the state assembly ...	Lisa Simpson
a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need ... my hero ...	Lisa Simpson
maxine lombard .	Lisa Simpson

assemblywoman lombard ! you got my emails !	Lisa Simpson

i 'm not screwing you over . no , uh ... i 'm not screwing you over . i 'm not screwing you over .	Homer Simpson
i 'm so proud of you , poppa .	Bart Simpson
some folks will tell you that fracking 's no good . but what they do n't tell you is ... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs .	Homer Simpson
and all those new workers are gon na want to spend their earnings buying what you 're selling : beer .	Homer Simpson
authentic italian food .	Homer Simpson
useless left-handed crap .	Homer Simpson
magical nonsense .	Homer Simpson
expensive toys for grownups they do n't open or play with .	Homer Simpson
pornography and nachos .	Homer Simpson
high-quality spanish language programming .	Homer Simpson
high-quality methamphetamines .	Homer Simpson
laundry . homework . pranks . poop , poop and poop .	Homer Simpson
but our water was on fire .	Marge Simpson
how could you sell fracking for mr. burns ?	Lisa Simpson
because i 've never gotten a promotion before . once i thought i had , but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing . so judge me all you want .	Homer Simpson
i am judging you .	Lisa Simpson
good , judge away .	Homer Simpson
judge-judge-judge --	Lisa Simpson
everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr. burns gets five thousand dollars !	Homer Simpson

mr. burns , we did it ! everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights .	Homer Simpson
excellent ?	Homer Simpson
well ... one .	Homer Simpson
oh baby ...	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm no carl when it comes to this stuff . but i ai n't no lenny neither . and i would say ... no matter how much you try to keep things casual , someone always gets hurt .	Homer Simpson
glad i could be of help ...	Homer Simpson
marge ? why did n't you sign ?	Homer Simpson
our water was on fire !	Marge Simpson
marge simpson ... i 'm as mad at you as you usually are at me .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , great . great , marge . great work . thanks to you , springfield will never be a natural gas boom town . and like all boom towns it would have lasted forever .	Homer Simpson
our water was on fire .	Marge Simpson
was on fire . was . i finally get a job i was good at , and now i have to give it up .	Homer Simpson
wait , mr. burns ! i 'm here to man up -- it was all my wife 's fault ! sometimes i think she and i have nothing in common .	Homer Simpson
marge likes sushi , i like gum that squirts in your mouth . she 's into romantic comedies , i like movies where there 's only one day a year when murder is legal . yep , marge and i see the world in totally different ways .	Homer Simpson
so you do n't miss that politics lady at all ?	Homer Simpson
killdozers .	Homer Simpson
gravy thursday .	Homer Simpson
is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes ?	Marge Simpson
y-e-e-e-s .	Lisa Simpson
homer ! turn off that horrible machine !	Marge Simpson
you do n't know anything about hydraulic fracturing ! you 've just been brainwashed by liberal tv shows who use `` fracking '' as an easy bad guy . but it can save this country !	Homer Simpson
our . water . was . on . fire !	Marge Simpson
wait ... i finally get what you 're saying . fracking is great . but the only place it should ever happen is in other people 's towns !	Homer Simpson
you always do the right thing ... sort of .	Marge Simpson
hey , a couch is a couch .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
i 'm offended you think i forgot . let 's see ...	Bart Simpson
ta-da !	Bart Simpson
better make this count .	Bart Simpson
my sandwich !	Marge Simpson
what the hell was that ? !	Homer Simpson
probably just another piece of america 's space junk falling out of orbit .	Lisa Simpson
remember when this country did n't suck ? 'cause i do n't .	Bart Simpson
homer ! homer . i think there 's someone downstairs .	Marge Simpson
relax , marge . it 's probably just homer comin ' home late from moe 's .	Homer Simpson
the eyes in that picture are following me .	Homer Simpson
uh , that 's a mirror .	Bart Simpson
is n't all great art kind of a mirror ?	Homer Simpson
we 'd better send the dog down . come on . here 's your chance to protect us , boy . come on .	Homer Simpson
stupid dog !	Homer Simpson
we 'll have to set a trap , bait . i mean , bart .	Homer Simpson

yeah ! hey , uh , what 's the robot version of bromance ?	Homer Simpson
you future guys have a word for everything ... pal .	Homer Simpson
you know , they look a little similar .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , like the guy who designed bender just took a drawing of dad and stuck an antenna on it .	Bart Simpson
a little lazy if you ask me .	Lisa Simpson
regardless , i see no reason to believe that `` bender '' is from the future . robotic technology today is very advanced .	Lisa Simpson
it 's not my birthday . although maggie 's is pretty soon .	Lisa Simpson
this is the robot who claims to be from the future .	Lisa Simpson
my ears are burning .	Homer Simpson
a boxing glove !	Homer Simpson
but we bowled together .	Homer Simpson
what stopped you , bender ? asimov 's three laws of robotics ?	Lisa Simpson
you do n't have to announce it . just do it quietly and blame the dog .	Homer Simpson
what the ?	Homer Simpson
wait , stop ! why must you kill my dad ? especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'll explain . okay , it starts free , right ?	Homer Simpson
then you visit your friend 's game , and he 's got this awesome candy mansion ...	Homer Simpson
... and you 're like `` ninety-nine cents ? you bet i 'd like one ... ''	Homer Simpson
and that 's why i owe clash of candies twenty thousand dollars . here we are .	Homer Simpson
marge , i 'd like you to meet leela and fry .	Homer Simpson
oh , do n't mention her eye . do n't mention her eye .	Marge Simpson
i am so pleased to meet you .	Marge Simpson
professor farnsworth , i 'm dying to know how you got here . was it a time machine ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's it ! all we have to do is dig up the time capsule !	Lisa Simpson
but you just said that --	Lisa Simpson
start with flanders ... start with flanders ...	Homer Simpson
who is that ? !	Homer Simpson
well that 's better .	Marge Simpson
what a surprise -- it 's bart .	Lisa Simpson
wow , i 'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later . ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
well ...	Bart Simpson

can you please just get us out of this lousy future ?	Marge Simpson
it is , 'cause my baby 's not in it !	Marge Simpson
homer works at a nuclear plant ! he can help us get home !	Marge Simpson
i was voted employee of the month as an april fool 's day joke . why you little ... why you little ...	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you 're all giving up without a fight .	Lisa Simpson
let me take care of that . if there 's one thing i know how to do , it 's manipulate barts .	Lisa Simpson
you 're nuts . i 've got a will of iron .	Bart Simpson
dad , we have beer in our time !	Lisa Simpson
hey , i have n't had a drink in a thousand years .	Homer Simpson
attention goblins : madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars . and people are laying fingers all over them .	Lisa Simpson
they 're evolving ! wow . that 's a first for you , bart .	Lisa Simpson
will you shut up ?	Bart Simpson
you realize you 're cheering the death of millions of my children .	Bart Simpson
what the ?	Homer Simpson
aww , i will treasure this forever .	Homer Simpson
my sweet baby ! ooh , it feels like you have a full diaper .	Marge Simpson
wait , wait , wait ! you 're the portal . how are you going to get to the future ?	Lisa Simpson
good night , friend . you 'll always have a special place here with us .	Homer Simpson
simpsons , in the / future -- space jokes ! / flying through town / what are those tubes / i wonder what / ice cream 's like now / maybe it 's hot / or some new temperature they invented ... that 's it , we 're done .	Homer Simpson
i dunno . but in ten minutes i 'm gon na have him kneeling before zod . in this example , i 'm zod .	Bart Simpson
when he opens the door ...	Bart Simpson
i will not . anything to delay a spelling test !	Bart Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
how was your first day at school , bart ?	Marge Simpson
terrible .	Bart Simpson
you wan na talk about it ?	Homer Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
oh , thank you .	Homer Simpson

no , you 'll laugh at me .	Bart Simpson
i wo n't laugh at you . let 's see --	Homer Simpson
look at me ! i 'm bart !	Homer Simpson
we 're sorry .	Lisa Simpson
stop that , all of you . it 's not bart 's fault that his haircut looks so stupid .	Marge Simpson
i did n't know that a teacher could cut kids ' hair .	Marge Simpson
teachers union won the right in their last strike .	Bart Simpson
i 'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher .	Marge Simpson
marge , please do n't say anything . it never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs .	Homer Simpson
well , if he 's gon na get a haircut , bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it .	Marge Simpson
well , anyway bart , you 'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend .	Marge Simpson
what camping trip ?	Homer Simpson
the one you booked for us at owl haven . the one you have to reserve a year in advance .	Marge Simpson
oh , uh ... you told me not to do it a year ago . remember ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't remember that !	Marge Simpson
you 're right . no one could be expected to remember something from a year ago . certainly not me . pass the gravy ?	Homer Simpson
do n't tell me you did n't reserve a campsite ! labor day is next weekend , there 'll be nothing left !	Marge Simpson
hey , there 's always room at buzzard 's roost .	Homer Simpson
excuse me , but buzzard 's roost is a converted parking lot .	Lisa Simpson
excuse me , but grass is poking through .	Homer Simpson
why do i ever put you in charge of the littlest thing ?	Marge Simpson
parking lot .	Lisa Simpson
poking through .	Homer Simpson
parking lot .	Lisa Simpson
poking through .	Homer Simpson
my biggest sin is that i dare to hope .	Marge Simpson
oh , marge , i ca n't stand it when you cry at dinner . the pork chops look traumatized . the mashed potatoes ca n't stand watch . even the children seem upset . so trust me , i will come through for you , baby .	Homer Simpson
not you .	Homer Simpson
so , what do you say , marge ?	Homer Simpson
i want so much to believe you .	Marge Simpson
and i want you to believe me too . is n't it great how much we agree ?	Homer Simpson
hello ? hello ? is everything okay ?	Lisa Simpson
excuse me , you ruined my report .	Lisa Simpson
oh ! yippee ! fourth-grade a !	Lisa Simpson
milhouse , i am gon na get back at lassen . now `` the hobbit '' taught us that every dragon has a chink in its armor .	Bart Simpson
compared to the rest of these people , yeah .	Homer Simpson
i 've created a fake miss hoover profile . when lassen friends her , we 'll know everything about him .	Bart Simpson
we 've all read the terms and conditions , milhouse .	Bart Simpson
look , i really need a campsite . my wife is making sandwiches !	Homer Simpson
what about mosquito cove ?	Homer Simpson
skunk canyon ?	Homer Simpson
ooh ! how 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers ?	Homer Simpson
hello ? hello ? this is homer simpson ! 742 evergreen terrace , looking for a place for my kids and me ! and my pretty , pretty wife !	Homer Simpson

i was trying to even it out !	Bart Simpson
nooo !	Bart Simpson
gosh ... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up .	Lisa Simpson
those were your father 's sweatpants .	Marge Simpson
marge , i have a confession to make about this trip .	Homer Simpson
dad , do n't worry , i got you a place .	Bart Simpson

a camping we will go ...	Homer Simpson
but where ? i still do n't know !	Marge Simpson
a place that 's filled with sun and sand / a desert steampunk disneyland / keep expectations lowww ... / swing low sweet chariot ...	Homer Simpson
homer simpson , i love you .	Homer Simpson
a world of anarchic free expression !	Lisa Simpson
cars shaped like cupcakes !	Homer Simpson
i 'm home !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not sure this campground is family-friendly .	Marge Simpson
all camping is pointless . you drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds . i guess what i 'm trying to say is : where 's maggie ?	Homer Simpson
we brought cheerios for you !	Marge Simpson
uh , listen here , desert arnaz . homer simpson knows how to pitch a tent .	Homer Simpson
hey man , can i bum a tent ?	Homer Simpson
finally . a normal person . thank you , miss ... um ...	Marge Simpson
is that tea ... adulterated ?	Marge Simpson
hey marge !	Homer Simpson
we got a new tent from a guy who o.d . 'd !	Homer Simpson
aw , let me get a picture of that .	Homer Simpson
so many musical choices !	Lisa Simpson
a brass band ... barbershop quintet ? ... the human kazoo ... ooh , a drum circle !	Lisa Simpson
there he is .	Bart Simpson
milhouse , everyone here is a total freak . we have to find a way to completely humiliate lassen .	Bart Simpson
suddenly this place does n't seem so bad .	Marge Simpson
this place is great . just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses !	Homer Simpson
ooh . are you mr. clean ?	Marge Simpson
no . this ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life . and i 'm gon na wreck it . because he scarred me forever !	Bart Simpson
enough !	Bart Simpson
it 's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain .	Marge Simpson
get ... in ... the tent !	Homer Simpson
you always save me , trombone elephant .	Marge Simpson
fire retardant ? !	Bart Simpson
if lassen ca n't light that thing , he 'll be humiliated . what good is an ignis who ca n't blaze the guy ?	Bart Simpson
homie , you promised me an incredible camping trip and i got one .	Marge Simpson
just like i planned .	Homer Simpson
you got very lucky this time . do n't push it .	Marge Simpson
i understand . i already signed up for this place next year . i gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude .	Homer Simpson
help me , desert weirdoes !	Bart Simpson
i 'll take those .	Homer Simpson
beware the butterfly 's sting ! what the ?	Homer Simpson
hey listen , we should probably get home . my dad forgot to bring water .	Bart Simpson
when will this tea get out of my system ?	Marge Simpson
what the ?	Marge Simpson
... and that 's the terrifying tale of how the quebec nordiques became the colorado avalanche .	Homer Simpson
oh no ! king toot 's is closed ! dad , you 're gon na have to take me to the ... big box music store .	Lisa Simpson
look at all these monstrosities .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , how many times have i told you to bow down to our corporate overlords ?	Homer Simpson
( impressed noise	Lisa Simpson
it 's like some kind of guitar central .	Homer Simpson
stig . you 've got a name that 's not a name .	Homer Simpson
oh , i do n't have what it takes to play guitar . i mean , i 'm no joe walsh in the brains department .	Homer Simpson
what the rock ?	Homer Simpson
i did a lick ?	Homer Simpson
oh my god ... i 'm amazing .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not set at all .	Homer Simpson
this is embarrassing to admit , stig , but i had n't even thought about gels .	Homer Simpson
what is that racket ?	Marge Simpson
music ! beautiful music !	Homer Simpson
what ?	Marge Simpson
beautiful music , baby .	Homer Simpson
the bass guitar ? this does n't really seem like ... you .	Marge Simpson
sure it is . you know i 've always loved laying things down . grooves are just the latest .	Homer Simpson
i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players . like what 's his name from the who . or that guy from led zeppelin who was n't page , plant or bonham . those are the only two i know for sure .	Homer Simpson
it 's so cool to have another musician in the family !	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah , and you know what 's the great thing is about music ? it 's so easy .	Homer Simpson
uh , well to truly master an instrument you 'll need years of --	Lisa Simpson
so easy .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't take it . all homer does is play that stupid bass ! doink doink doink doink doink doink doink !	Marge Simpson
i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming .	Marge Simpson
oh my god , oh my god , oh my god . what if -- all the dads jammed together ... in a dad band ? !	Marge Simpson
i do n't know guys . i 'm not sure i 'm feeling this . the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument .	Homer Simpson
i almost forgot the most important thing .	Homer Simpson
great practice , guys . what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day ?	Homer Simpson
oh ... yeah , apu , i 'm sure you 're a great singer . but the balance of the band is really delicate right now , and we 're not really looking for a `` world music '' vibe . no disrespect to world music . i love world music .	Homer Simpson
that sounds nothing like terrible , terrible world music .	Homer Simpson
guys , are you feeling this ? are you feeling this ?	Homer Simpson
we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families . we are now a cover band . and we shall be called ... covercraft . because we play covers and this is our craft .	Homer Simpson
that was not my intent . okay , covercraft : hands in .	Homer Simpson
cover ...	Homer Simpson
r `` o '' `` k '' `` c '' .	Homer Simpson
okay , this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new .	Homer Simpson
apu , what 's wrong ?	Homer Simpson
you do n't know what a per diem is .	Marge Simpson
i still want one .	Homer Simpson
buddy , buddy . think of it this way : you 're not singing in front of all those people , you 're alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night . you just wear this on stage , and everything will be fine .	Homer Simpson
everyone loves you , dad . you could become a famous rock star !	Bart Simpson
well son , i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write ... down the names of and then cover . but then i remember : i 'm just a regular guy , jamming with my buds .	Homer Simpson
oh , sweetie . this band has brought out the best in you .	Marge Simpson
yeah , you really get that it 's all about the music .	Lisa Simpson
yep . it 's all about the music ... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that . pretty unforeseen ...	Homer Simpson
guys , i really need your honesty here . at the squidport senior jamboree ... was i too in the pocket ?	Homer Simpson
how ?	Homer Simpson
what kind of erotic asphyxiation ?	Homer Simpson
oh ...	Homer Simpson
i think i can answer for apu . he 's flattered , but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted .	Homer Simpson
apu has a rich life here in springfield : a store full of great products , a lovely him-type wife , and eight super kids : anoop , sandeep , nabendu , gheet , pria , uma , poonam , sashi --	Homer Simpson
not me . i 'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune .	Homer Simpson
i want his fame and fortune so much ! why must the lords of rock be so cruel ? !	Homer Simpson
sammy hagar ? you 're not dead .	Homer Simpson
what 's a game show ?	Bart Simpson
it 's something you make sketches about .	Homer Simpson
dad , you should n't be jealous of apu . remember , it 's all about the music .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not jealous . i 'm envious . jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have . envy is wanting what someone else has . what i feel is envy .	Homer Simpson
wow , he 's right .	Lisa Simpson
you know what ? apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band . we 're gon na be like genesis after peter gabriel left .	Homer Simpson
you mean more popular but not as good ?	Bart Simpson
phil collins-era genesis is not as good , huh ? `` no reply at all , '' `` land of confusion , '' `` throwing it all away , '' `` illegal alien , '' `` i ca n't dance , '' and i 'm sure i do n't need to mention ... `` invisible touch ! ''	Homer Simpson
what ? so you can also get famous and bail on us ? you 're out of the band !	Homer Simpson
oh , so you 're sticking up for yoko here ? looks like i 've got another yoko on my hands .	Homer Simpson
yoko ! yoko ! yoko ! yoko ! yoko ! all you yokos are out of the band !	Homer Simpson
are you okay ?	Marge Simpson
do i sound okay ?	Homer Simpson
you sound great ! your licks are really ... juicy .	Marge Simpson
they 're not juicy . my licks are dry . dry and scratchy like a cat 's tongue .	Homer Simpson
you did n't join a band to become famous like in `` almost famous . '' you loved playing music with your friends . that was enough to make you happy .	Marge Simpson
well it 's not enough anymore . when something great happens to one person , everyone else 's life gets a little worse . look it up , it 's called physics .	Homer Simpson
apu is a good man . he sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the costington center .	Marge Simpson
oh , you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star ?	Homer Simpson
stop feeling sorry for yourself . your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him , and you are coming with us to share in his talent .	Marge Simpson
i 'll never have a per diem .	Homer Simpson
apu would n't be able to sing a note if i did n't help him get over his stage fright with his kwik-e-mart shirt ...	Homer Simpson
backstage pass , you just became a payback rage pass .	Homer Simpson
look at all this rock star dressing room stuff . what a sellout . cheese plate -- oh , sorry , cubed cheese plate , lemon tea , probably for his throat ...	Homer Simpson
let 's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , apu . i thought you were living your dream life , so naturally i wanted to ruin it . but now i know things stink , so i 'm okay with it .	Homer Simpson
kwik-e-mart hot dog , eh ?	Homer Simpson
hopin ' ! hopin ' !	Homer Simpson
i 'll be right home , honey . i 've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening .	Homer Simpson
tight as a drum .	Homer Simpson
see you soon !	Marge Simpson
bart ! hold the ladder still !	Marge Simpson
wish homer was here .	Marge Simpson
mr. scrooge !	Homer Simpson
hello ?	Marge Simpson
headin ' home , baby .	Homer Simpson
nothing 's gon na stop me now .	Homer Simpson
maybe a drink will help me with my driving .	Homer Simpson
i 'd better be heading home ... to my family ... enjoy your evening ... with your wonderful ... uh ... neon sign ...	Homer Simpson
hey , um , you gon na be okay ?	Homer Simpson

marge , think about what you 're saying . it 's sir isaac newton 's birthday !	Homer Simpson

the ghost of marge future !	Homer Simpson
moe , what are you doing ?	Homer Simpson

gim me another one .	Homer Simpson
gim me another one .	Homer Simpson
gim me another one .	Homer Simpson
gim me another one .	Homer Simpson

aw , thanks for your honesty , apu . is there any other product in the store you 'd like to warn me about ?	Homer Simpson
wow .	Homer Simpson
christmas eve . the one night a kid wants to go to sleep is the one night he ca n't . i ca n't have another cocoa .	Bart Simpson
my pee is starting to smell like a ski chalet .	Bart Simpson
oh , thank god you are here . i need to get to sleep . tell me the story of jazz again .	Bart Simpson
well , the story of jazz starts with the tresillo , the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-saharan african music , but the rest will have to wait . bart , bart , i hear mom sobbing and i do n't know where dad is !	Lisa Simpson
if it helps , i made you a card .	Bart Simpson
bart ! this is the year i 've got to nail christmas . i do n't want to be a jaded ten-year-old like you !	Lisa Simpson
ah , yes ... i remember christmas eve when i was eight .	Bart Simpson
why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't wan na ruin the magic and i certainly	Homer Simpson
next year ... this is ... your job .	Homer Simpson
... ...	Homer Simpson
... ooh ! ... ...	Homer Simpson
they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on christmas eve . i 'll help you , kid .	Bart Simpson
mom , i 'm just a kid . but i say if dad is n't here christmas morning , that 's the kind of thing families never recover from .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , sweetie , i 'm tired of being a pushover .	Marge Simpson
you 're not a pushover .	Bart Simpson
you ca n't smoke !	Marge Simpson
just chewing on the wood .	Bart Simpson
okay then !	Marge Simpson
moe szyslak . you did n't climb down our chimney just to say `` merry christmas . ''	Marge Simpson
oh , my poor homie ! this is what i was hoping for ... for it not to have been completely his fault ! thank you , moe .	Marge Simpson
that 's lettuce caught in a spider 's web .	Bart Simpson
i 've got ta call homer .	Marge Simpson
no answer . let 's go find your father .	Marge Simpson
what ? i never give up hope .	Marge Simpson
even the anchor store 's closed .	Homer Simpson
any uplifting holiday movies ?	Homer Simpson
i guess i 'll take the concentration camp one .	Homer Simpson
well , if i 've got ta spend christmas eve alone , at least no one will see me .	Homer Simpson
what if i left now , and gave you guys my popcorn and soda ?	Homer Simpson
flanders ? what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
say flanders , with all the hard luck you 've had , how do you stay so happy ? and do n't say `` jesus . ''	Homer Simpson
flanders , are you crying ?	Homer Simpson
listen . could i buy a left-handed uh ... i do n't know , eyelash curler ?	Homer Simpson
um . maybe .	Homer Simpson
because jerk-ass homer has become ass-jerk homer .	Homer Simpson
you 're all right , stupid flanders . you 're all right .	Homer Simpson
i made everyone happy but me . some christmas . feliz navidad .	Homer Simpson
abe simpson , please .	Marge Simpson
i thought we were just going to ask if he had seen homer .	Bart Simpson
i 'm afraid we 've awoken a needy giant .	Lisa Simpson
well , with all that you folks have experienced , i think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom .	Marge Simpson
no casual racism !	Marge Simpson
what the ?	Homer Simpson
the nutcracker ! every child 's favorite christmas character ! is this a dream ?	Homer Simpson
man , you are a nutcracker . but i 've learned something tonight : you know how everyone hates being with their family on christmas ? well , being without them is worse . can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break ?	Homer Simpson
what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
well , he 's not in the neon sign store .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry . i 'm trying to find my husband and nothing 's open .	Marge Simpson
where is this party ? !	Marge Simpson
oh my god . is that girl really doing that ?	Homer Simpson
mmm , load-bearing wall .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
this party 's great . but all i wish is that i was drinking a beer with my kids right now .	Homer Simpson
homer ?	Marge Simpson
hm ?	Homer Simpson
homie , i 'm your present tonight . and the present is that i 'm not gon na always assume that you screwed up . because i realize maybe there 's a good explanation for what you do . or a crazy one that 's pretty entertaining .	Marge Simpson
oh marge , you found me ! you always find me . now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot .	Homer Simpson
i thought i had one of those chirping keys .	Marge Simpson
oh , well , i 've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best .	Homer Simpson
you did n't have to do that . i love you just the same .	Marge Simpson
thank you magical creatures of the mall .	Homer Simpson
you have all taught me a christmas message i 'll never forget : the place to get drunk is at home .	Homer Simpson

bart ! you know you ca n't open a present till mom and dad wake up !	Lisa Simpson
it 's nine-ten a.m. ! i know what they 're doing . they 're up in bed watching the rebroadcast of the hollywood christmas parade .	Bart Simpson
oops . my finger slipped .	Bart Simpson
oops . so did mine .	Lisa Simpson

you planted that on me , man !	Homer Simpson
fine . but i 'm not paying for the insurance . oh , what the hell , give me the insurance .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , maggie . the first ride we go on will be for you .	Marge Simpson
bug be damned !	Bart Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
whoa , this place sure has changed since dizznee bought the rights to cosmic wars .	Lisa Simpson
pirates of the caribbean !	Bart Simpson
they revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people .	Lisa Simpson
not enough ketchup !	Bart Simpson
we have been here six hours and the coolest thing we 've done is stand in the cool zone .	Lisa Simpson
how 'bout that one ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't like the end sounds on that .	Marge Simpson
well , that 's it . we 've visited every section including churro county , toonton abbey ... but you know what we have n't had here ? i 'll tell you : fun . the kind of fun attractive families have in commercials .	Homer Simpson
hey , dad , i see a ride that actually looks decent !	Bart Simpson
i just wan na sit down , but the line for the bench is too long .	Homer Simpson
no , look ! it 's a ride that just opened and no one 's there !	Bart Simpson
dad , i do n't know about this . it 's not on the park map .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park , hundreds of years ago . let 's go .	Homer Simpson
come on ! start this thing ! i 'm not impressed .	Homer Simpson
this is so fake .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
we 've left earth 's atmosphere !	Lisa Simpson
prove it .	Homer Simpson
are we there yet ? are we there yet ?	Lisa Simpson
are we there yet ?	Lisa Simpson
what the ? this is n't halloween .	Homer Simpson
are we truly in space ? and if so , why ?	Lisa Simpson
why does the last thing you say sound so ominous ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's good .	Homer Simpson
hey , captain squid ! if you really want to be nice to us , how 'bout some snacks ?	Homer Simpson
potato chips !	Homer Simpson
stupid kid ! you ruin every trip !	Homer Simpson
homer ... homer ...	Marge Simpson
homer , please ! that 's creeping me out !	Marge Simpson
let me just ... there you are ... like new ... not a freak of nature ...	Homer Simpson
look at all these knobs and buttons . they are clearly a superior race . but maybe that means they 'll be nice to us .	Homer Simpson
you mean like europeans were to the native americans ? or the belgians were to the congo ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's right . pick the only two times in history where things got messy .	Homer Simpson
who 's gon na stop me ?	Bart Simpson
wow . this place is completely alien but everything 's in english . just like canada .	Homer Simpson
can i turn my phone on ?	Homer Simpson
now what ?	Lisa Simpson
i say we take this bucket home !	Homer Simpson
to earth !	Homer Simpson
come on ... come on ... you son of a --	Homer Simpson
are there any side effects ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , you really went with the purple theme .	Homer Simpson
so , you use a lot of solar energy ?	Lisa Simpson
aww .	Marge Simpson
why are you sharing all of this with us ?	Lisa Simpson
wait , are you telling me we 're prisoners in this cage ? !	Homer Simpson
right hand red !	Lisa Simpson
i win , i think .	Lisa Simpson
thanks .	Lisa Simpson
i thought it was a ball !	Lisa Simpson
see , marge ?	Homer Simpson
you 're the doctor .	Homer Simpson
homer ! you have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they 're a doctor !	Marge Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
are you the guy that talks nice before they kill us ?	Bart Simpson
there 's only one fair solution : we have to put it to a vote .	Marge Simpson
before we vote , i 'd just like to point out in sophie 's choice she saved the boy .	Bart Simpson
this is n't a happy thing !	Homer Simpson
here you go .	Lisa Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
what the ? !	Homer Simpson
well , we have n't heard from maggie yet .	Homer Simpson
what the ? pfft . gibberish ! pure gibberish !	Homer Simpson
you 're the last vote , homie .	Marge Simpson
't is a far , far better thing i do than i have ever done before .	Homer Simpson
hey look , maggie made you a farewell card .	Bart Simpson
that kid 's got talent , but c'mon !	Homer Simpson
now do you see why i 'm a vegetarian , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
i get it , lisa . i finally get it .	Homer Simpson
i 'd like rabbit . lots of rabbit .	Homer Simpson
does n't your culture say anything about mercy ?	Marge Simpson
fondue ? welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine .	Homer Simpson
yes ! this mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good . so long you stupid slobbering ... what the ?	Homer Simpson
and away we go !	Homer Simpson
way to go , george mucus . the fattest , stupidest man on earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles .	Bart Simpson
it 's called a knot .	Lisa Simpson
knot with a k .	Lisa Simpson
that 's correct .	Lisa Simpson
so , what do you eat , space broccoli ?	Homer Simpson
where are you taking me ?	Homer Simpson
why are they dancing ? should n't they be making weapons ?	Homer Simpson
... but perhaps earth 's greatest achievement is moon rocks . oh , and the golden age of radio .	Homer Simpson
what about my family ?	Homer Simpson
sex mate ? clearly you 've never been married . but it 's great , i 'm telling you .	Homer Simpson
well , it is a great party .	Homer Simpson
suddenly , this trip has gotten interesting .	Homer Simpson
what the ? !	Homer Simpson
oh who am i kidding ? i could n't enjoy calorie one without my family . i 'm going back to save them .	Homer Simpson
this system is really rigged against us .	Lisa Simpson
you forgot to glaze me !	Homer Simpson
i think somebody 's afraid to admit he 's out of glaze .	Homer Simpson
glaze , please .	Homer Simpson
what 's that ?	Homer Simpson
it does look delicious .	Homer Simpson
um , are you sure you do n't want to try me again ?	Lisa Simpson
really ? but i thought ...	Lisa Simpson
what ? !	Marge Simpson
dad said i could try it .	Bart Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
do n't you people realize your queen is dying ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't see any breasts .	Bart Simpson
captain 's log , star date : six-five-eight-four-eight point two . after successfully conquering the rigelians ...	Homer Simpson
right . conquering .	Lisa Simpson
at least maggie can fly us home .	Bart Simpson
thank god it 's just like her busy box .	Marge Simpson
i have such a big ass .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess we 've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe , we have evolved into the most inedible species . like three bean salad at a barbecue , we will remain untouched .	Lisa Simpson
we 're receiving a transmission from an unknown source !	Marge Simpson
set a course , mr. maggie . anywhere but home .	Homer Simpson
walkin ' down a corridor / usin ' both my feet / wish i was in floridor / now i will repeat / oh i 'm walkin ' down a corridor / usin ' both my feet ...	Homer Simpson
we sure will miss your , your , um , uh -- what 'd you do again ?	Homer Simpson
but , wait a minute ! that 's my job !	Homer Simpson
that would explain a lot . but why did you do it ?	Homer Simpson
no , please ! all i 'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years !	Homer Simpson
how was your day ?	Marge Simpson
stressful . do you see how loose my tie is ?	Homer Simpson
for the first time i actually had to do my job .	Homer Simpson
oh , sweetie ...	Marge Simpson
and marge , i 've got this weird new feeling in my stomach . a little sour and a little sick .	Homer Simpson
there 's a yiddish word for it : `` shpilkes . ''	Marge Simpson
they have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things .	Homer Simpson
look , i do n't have time for childish games . if i do n't do my job , atoms go boom !	Homer Simpson
yes , sir . yes , sir . can i get a four fifty-five wakeup call ?	Homer Simpson
i thought we were n't allowed to do homework at the table .	Lisa Simpson
it 's called a double standard . one of the bedrocks of parenting .	Homer Simpson
you 've been working so hard lately . maybe you should take a break .	Marge Simpson
no . marge , if i lose my job in this economy , it 's a death sentence . oh , i guess , as a fallback , i could direct films like angelina jolie . how many properties do we have an option on ?	Homer Simpson
none .	Marge Simpson
what ? ! when were you gon na tell me ?	Homer Simpson
when ? !	Homer Simpson
homie ... workaholic is probably your best `` aholic '' ever , but you need to relax ... so i got us all tickets to see the circus on saturday .	Marge Simpson
the circus ? hmmm , i have n't been to the circus since i was a kid .	Homer Simpson
is that true ?	Bart Simpson
okay , marge . we can go to the circus . maybe i can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion .	Homer Simpson
dammit ! this circus wi-fi is a joke !	Homer Simpson
i thought you were going to try to relax .	Marge Simpson
how can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking ?	Homer Simpson
i knew he was n't gon na like the stack parking .	Lisa Simpson
what kind of insane parking system is designed so you 're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you ? !	Homer Simpson
the early bird gets the shaft !	Homer Simpson
oh my god . what if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us ? maybe there 's better wi-fi in the freak tent .	Homer Simpson
'scuse me , pardon me , what the hell ?	Homer Simpson
oh ! finally ! the business call i 've been waiting for ! hello , this is --	Homer Simpson
come on , kids ! there 's nothing you 'd be interested in here .	Homer Simpson
eh , they 'll grow back .	Homer Simpson
homer , i have to use the porta potty .	Marge Simpson
oh for god 's -- now ? do you have to ?	Homer Simpson
no woman uses one of these by choice .	Marge Simpson
hey dad , since we 've got ta wait , ca n't we please see an act ?	Bart Simpson
fine . but i 'll be amazed if i 'm astounded .	Homer Simpson
hey , is that time right ? i have a deadline in an hour and a half !	Homer Simpson

how do you break up with a guy ?	Homer Simpson
here 's what you do . you just take his hand , look in his eyes and say `` i do n't want to be with you anymore . ''	Marge Simpson
wow , you 're good at that .	Homer Simpson
it 's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships .	Marge Simpson
oh my god ! oh my god ! you saved my life . which is gon na make what i 'm about to say even more awkward ...	Homer Simpson
elon , elon , elon ! i want to say something to you and i do n't want you to be inspired by it . i want you to listen .	Homer Simpson
i do n't want to be with you anymore .	Homer Simpson
i could say it 's the being shot at or the flat , emotionless way you talk or the fact that paypal was my idea and i was just about to do it when you came out with it ... but really it 's that this town is n't ready for you , and neither am i .	Homer Simpson

we 've got a big sinkhole ...	Lisa Simpson
and they shut down the thinkhole ...	Bart Simpson
hashtag `` springfield pride '' has never ever trend-ed .	Lisa Simpson

that 's not a healthy way to lose weight .	Marge Simpson
it 's not about health , marge . it 's about going crazy .	Homer Simpson

they taught me that i do n't need to lose weight , i should just be proud of what i am .	Homer Simpson
what ? !	Marge Simpson
restore ! restore !	Marge Simpson
it 's not what you think . his name is albert and he taught me not to buy into the lies taught by `` big nutrition . ''	Homer Simpson
that 's worse than what i thought !	Marge Simpson
marge , you 're my wife of ten years and i love you . but i must observe the teachings of this man i just met tonight . now , the first thing i have to do is make amends ... with the bathroom scale .	Homer Simpson
i 'm so sorry i threw you across the room and called you a liar . when you told me i was two hundred and sixty pounds , you were just encouraging me . it was a poem you were writing about my potential . i 'm gon na start celebrating my size and i need you with me as a partner . now if you 'll excuse me , i need to talk to the broken porch swing .	Homer Simpson

we never dreamed .	Homer Simpson
sorry , fellas . there 's a movement i have to join . i 've learned there 's something more important than drinking : eating .	Homer Simpson
right here .	Homer Simpson
excuse me , pardon me , coming through .	Homer Simpson
comin ' back , 'scuse me , pardon me ...	Homer Simpson
there we go . comin ' up ... what can i do for you ?	Homer Simpson

homer , you have to choose . and i think the choice is clear .	Marge Simpson
guys , i 'm comin ' back in . suck in your guts .	Homer Simpson
who 's he giving a piggyback ride to ?	Marge Simpson
we do n't know .	Bart Simpson
mom , what 's wrong ?	Lisa Simpson
how come dad 's not with you ?	Bart Simpson
he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me .	Marge Simpson
mom , lisa and i learned we could solve any problem through song . lisa , let 's go write something that 'll change dad 's mind .	Bart Simpson
do you really think that we can write a song that does that ?	Lisa Simpson
i just wanted to get out of the room . she was really bumming me out .	Bart Simpson
aw , geez , i thought writing another hit song would be easier .	Bart Simpson
well , it would 've helped if you had n't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it .	Lisa Simpson
i was distinctly promised no math !	Homer Simpson
homer , i want to say something extremely important the way a woman does : subtly through someone else . kids ?	Marge Simpson
take it , bart !	Lisa Simpson
you take it !	Bart Simpson
i gave it to you !	Lisa Simpson
i refuse to accept it !	Bart Simpson
we could n't write a song . we 're one-hit wonders ! but , is that such a crime ? look at j.d . salinger .	Lisa Simpson
rubik 's cube !	Lisa Simpson
charles m. schulz .	Lisa Simpson
it 's her fault ! she was suckin ' all the gangsta out of everything !	Bart Simpson
well you 're the only `` gangsta '' i know with a nine o'clock bedtime !	Lisa Simpson
nine-thirty , starting in summer ! mom said !	Bart Simpson
oh , kids , stop arguing . or keep arguing . i do n't care . homer , i 'm sorry i tried to help you control your weight . i 'm not sure of anything anymore . sorry i ever open my mouth .	Marge Simpson
marge , it 's not your fault that you ca n't win against a superior being like albert .	Homer Simpson
but marge , i do n't want you to ever stop caring about me .	Homer Simpson
how can you follow a leader who wo n't even get up out of his chair ?	Marge Simpson
marge , i believe you 're forgetting america 's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader : professor x of the x-men .	Homer Simpson
it 's not that professor x would n't get up , it 's that he could n't .	Marge Simpson
i 've never written an eulogy before , but this time i did . unfortunately , i left it at home .	Homer Simpson
thanks , lady .	Homer Simpson
what albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted . he knew what was important was how you lived your life every day ... till he was taken from us too soon at the age of ...	Homer Simpson
twenty-three ? ! people , for god 's sake , join a gym .	Homer Simpson
marge , i 'm sorry i was proud of myself .	Homer Simpson
that 's not really what i was --	Marge Simpson
it will never happen again . now come on , let 's walk home .	Homer Simpson
absolutely .	Marge Simpson
can i ask you something ? what is it that keeps you with me ?	Homer Simpson
it 's because everything you love , you love so much .	Marge Simpson
and because you love me , i will not stop yo-yo dieting till i get it right .	Homer Simpson
at last .	Homer Simpson
marge ! stop that crazy thing !	Homer Simpson
i 've printed out our driving plan ! if we work together , we can get bart to his sports ... lisa to her music ... and maggie to the five birthday parties she 's invited to today .	Marge Simpson

ooh , mom . someone wants you to give them a ride .	Lisa Simpson
at last ! i 'll earn money for schlepping !	Marge Simpson
you 're welcome . and if you really want to get your belly button pierced , go see a professional .	Marge Simpson
i 'm ... i 'm sorry , but i 'm not your mother .	Marge Simpson
fine . there 's meatloaf ...	Marge Simpson

feminine ? !	Homer Simpson
i did n't mean to use that word ! it 's okay to have a feminine side . it 's good in fact !	Marge Simpson
whatever you want .	Marge Simpson

there was beer involved . i have two daughters . and i 've learned you have to let them go their own way . even the one-year-old .	Homer Simpson
majesty .	Marge Simpson
and the older one , i ca n't tell her what to do . and she 's only twelve .	Homer Simpson
eight .	Lisa Simpson
see what i mean ? always an argument .	Homer Simpson
but the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them ...	Homer Simpson
... uh , because you want them to grow ...	Homer Simpson
... and because you ca n't strangle a girl .	Homer Simpson
you 're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz .	Lisa Simpson
you never let me tell !	Lisa Simpson
what percentage of prayers really come true ?	Lisa Simpson
well , not all of them . like , um , ninety percent ?	Marge Simpson
god does n't hear my prayers . if he did , i 'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper .	Bart Simpson

i hope no one was hurt .	Marge Simpson
mom , the freezer broke and -- !	Bart Simpson
saluki strut !	Bart Simpson
but you do n't go to our church .	Marge Simpson
apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack .	Marge Simpson

okay ... there 's a song about , um ... how democrats and republicans ca n't get along . it 's called `` cats and dogs . ''	Marge Simpson
you got yourself one hell of a show , marge . one hell of a show .	Homer Simpson
disguises ? i 'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest .	Marge Simpson
i 'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm telling her !	Bart Simpson

i ca n't believe you 're gambling .	Lisa Simpson
it 's not gambling ! it 's math .	Marge Simpson
is dad in on this takedown ?	Bart Simpson
it 's not a takedown ! and i have n't told him about it -- yet .	Marge Simpson
but it 's okay for you guys to know , because you 're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information .	Marge Simpson
yeah , we are grown up .	Bart Simpson
i know how much to tip a waiter .	Lisa Simpson
i go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems .	Bart Simpson
i 'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money . but until then , i appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret .	Marge Simpson
homie , homie , i can finally tell you how we really got the money ...	Marge Simpson
marge ? some casino guys have me , and they want the money you took from them , or else .	Homer Simpson
this is all my fault .	Marge Simpson
just tell me one thing , marge . why did you lose faith in the revue ? i mean , `` cats and dogs '' writes itself . cats and dogs on capital hill / they do n't get along and never will	Homer Simpson
cats and dogs , squabble 's never ending / even with so much legislation pending !	Homer Simpson
homie . how did you end up at the casino ?	Marge Simpson
well , i was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap ...	Homer Simpson
mom 's counting cards at the casino !	Lisa Simpson
if anything happens to marge ... we 'll all be orphans !	Homer Simpson
i 'm comin ' for ya baby !	Homer Simpson
have you seen this woman ? have you ? have you seen my wife ?	Homer Simpson
do you know where she is ?	Homer Simpson
all right , as long as it 's just questions .	Homer Simpson
reverend ! reverend ! they took homer !	Marge Simpson
if we do n't give back the money we won counting cards , the casino people are going to hurt homer !	Marge Simpson
are you gon na put my head in a vise ?	Homer Simpson
stole ? how is counting cards stealing ?	Homer Simpson
is it even cheating ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't get it . football players can do the quarterback sneak , and baseball players can steal bases . why ca n't i just remember which cards have been played ?	Homer Simpson
i knew you had a vise ! i knew it !	Homer Simpson
god 's plan ? ! god is n't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs ! god is n't sky police . god did n't do this . i lied to my husband , and made my kids lie too ! we did this .	Marge Simpson
i 'm going to do what i should 've done in the first place .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know if you watch us all the time , or if we 're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf , and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we 've built .	Marge Simpson
maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them . maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe . and i 'm going to sit here and focus on that good , and maybe , just maybe , i 'll get my husband back .	Marge Simpson
my family loves your microwave lasagnas .	Marge Simpson
i want my husband back !	Marge Simpson
they sure did ... casino management .	Marge Simpson
no deal !	Homer Simpson
but we do n't need to come back . we saved the church .	Marge Simpson
no ! an injustice has gone on here for too long .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards . they 're just playing the game by the rules !	Homer Simpson
homie , after all this , do you still believe in god ?	Marge Simpson
on a beautiful night like tonight ... how could i not ?	Homer Simpson
ooo , careful , homer .	Marge Simpson
there 's no time to be careful .	Homer Simpson

i get the feeling there 's something you have n't told me , homer .	Marge Simpson
oh . i love you , marge .	Homer Simpson
homer , you tell me that all the time .	Marge Simpson
oh , good . because i do love you and i do n't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that wo n't set off that horrible beeping .	Homer Simpson
but i think it does have something to do with your christmas bonus . i keep asking for it , but ...	Marge Simpson
marge , well , let me be honest with you .	Homer Simpson

sorry , barney . i may be a total washout as a father , but i 'm not gon na take my kid to some sleazy dog track on christmas eve .	Homer Simpson
uh-uh .	Homer Simpson
ah , come on dad , this can be the miracle that saves the simpsons ' christmas . if tv has taught me anything , it 's that miracles always happen to poor kids at christmas . it happened to tiny tim , it happened to charlie brown , it happened to the smurfs , and it 's gon na happen to us .	Bart Simpson
well , okay . let 's go .	Homer Simpson
who 's tiny tim ?	Homer Simpson
oh , no !	Lisa Simpson

come on , dad . they 're all scrawny little bags of bones .	Bart Simpson
yeah , you 're right . i guess whirlwind is our only hope for a merry christmas .	Homer Simpson
it 's a coincidence , dad .	Bart Simpson
what are the odds on santa 's little helper ?	Homer Simpson
whoa ! ninety-nine times thirteen equals mer-ry christmas !	Homer Simpson
i got a bad feeling about this .	Bart Simpson
do n't you believe in me , son ?	Homer Simpson
uh ...	Bart Simpson
come on , boy . sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going .	Homer Simpson
oh , go for it , dad .	Bart Simpson
that 's my boy . everything on santa 's little helper .	Homer Simpson
yay !	Lisa Simpson
what , aunt patty ?	Lisa Simpson
well i wish you would n't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings , he 's the only father i have . therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships . so i hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me . and i am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts .	Lisa Simpson
come on , bart . kiss the ticket for good luck , not that we need it . heh-heh-heh .	Homer Simpson
come on , `` santa 's little helper ! ''	Bart Simpson

come on , boy .	Homer Simpson
come on , get that rabbit .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , dad . maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens .	Bart Simpson
it does n't seem possible , but i guess tv has betrayed me .	Bart Simpson
i do n't want to leave till our dog finishes .	Homer Simpson
ah , forget it . let 's go .	Homer Simpson
find any winners , son ?	Homer Simpson
sorry , dad .	Bart Simpson
look , dad . it 's santa 's little helper .	Bart Simpson
oh , no you do n't . no . no . get away from me . uh-uh .	Homer Simpson
oh , can we keep him dad , please ?	Bart Simpson
but he 's a loser . he 's pathetic . he 's ...	Homer Simpson

at the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves phoenix bound for santa fe .	Bart Simpson
it 's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car .	Bart Simpson
an hour later , a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off , but three times as many plus six get on .	Bart Simpson
oof !	Bart Simpson
at the second stop , half the passengers plus two get off , but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop .	Bart Simpson
i do n't have a ticket .	Bart Simpson
yaaaaahhh !	Bart Simpson
he 's a good boy now , and he 's getting better , and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard .	Marge Simpson

Homer Simpson

but homer , how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the man upstairs ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , marge , but sometimes i think we 're the worst family in town .	Homer Simpson
maybe we should move to a larger community .	Marge Simpson
do n't have a cow , dad .	Bart Simpson
the sad truth is all families are like us .	Lisa Simpson
you think so , huh ? well , there 's only one way to find out . follow me .	Homer Simpson

they 're having a conversation . they actually enjoy talking to each other .	Marge Simpson
i wish i could hear what they 're saying .	Homer Simpson
where 's he going ?	Lisa Simpson
probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers .	Homer Simpson

i 've got some wieners in my pocket .	Homer Simpson
you 're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling ?	Lisa Simpson
you know , moe , my mom once said something that really stuck with me . she said , `` homer , you 're a big disappointment , '' and , god bless her soul , she was really onto something .	Homer Simpson
you ca n't talk that way about my kids . or , at least two of them .	Homer Simpson
why , you ... here 's five you have n't met .	Homer Simpson

the fat guy on tv ?	Bart Simpson
boxing , lisa , boxing . there 's a world of difference .	Homer Simpson

... forty-eight , forty-nine , fifty . eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents .	Marge Simpson
that 's it ? that 's the college fund we 've been saving for all these years ?	Homer Simpson
i guess i 'd have needed a partial scholarship .	Lisa Simpson
well , we 're not licked yet . to save this family , we 're gon na have to make the supreme sacrifice .	Homer Simpson
no , dad ! please do n't pawn the tv !	Lisa Simpson
oh , c'mon dad ! anything but that !	Bart Simpson
homer , could n't we pawn my engagement ring instead ?	Marge Simpson
now , i appreciate that , honey , but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here .	Homer Simpson

ready as she 'll ever be !	Homer Simpson
all our money , the college funds , the tv . homer , you 're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you .	Marge Simpson

you did it , dad .	Bart Simpson
excuse me , dear . should n't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our tv back ?	Marge Simpson
that piece of junk ? forget it ! we 're going to get a new tv ! twenty-one-inch screen ... realistic flesh tones ... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays !	Homer Simpson

tough day at school , boy ?	Homer Simpson

so you had a little scuffle , eh ? hope you won .	Homer Simpson
i 'm gon na miss you , big guy .	Bart Simpson
bart , your mother has the fool idea that you 're upset about something .	Homer Simpson
dad ... i need help ... please ...	Bart Simpson
come on , bart , we do n't want your mother to see you crying . here , let me help you dry those tears .	Homer Simpson
so , what 's the problem , son ?	Homer Simpson
i had a run-in with a bully .	Bart Simpson
a bully ? !	Marge Simpson
come on , marge . i do n't bug you when you 're helping lisa .	Homer Simpson
well , bart , i hope you 're going straight to the principal about this .	Marge Simpson
i guess i could do that .	Bart Simpson
what ? and violate the code of the school yard ? i 'd rather bart died .	Homer Simpson
what on earth are you talking about , homer ?	Marge Simpson
the code of the school yard , marge ! the rules that teach a boy to be a man . let 's see ... do n't tattle ... always make fun of those different from you ... never say anything unless you 're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do ... hmmm , what else ... ?	Homer Simpson
i know .	Bart Simpson
oh homer , that 's ridiculous . bart , instead of fighting , why do n't you try a little understanding ?	Marge Simpson
what do you mean , mom ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , right ! this ought to be good for a laugh .	Homer Simpson
shh ! this bully friend of yours ... is he a little on the chunky side ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , - he 's pretty chunkified , all right .	Bart Simpson
huh huh . and i 'll bet he does n't do well in his studies either .	Marge Simpson
no . he 's pretty dumb . he 's in all the same special classes i am .	Bart Simpson
that 's why he lashes out at the world .	Marge Simpson
aw , marge .	Homer Simpson
so tomorrow , instead of bickering with this boy , talk to him . you 'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go .	Marge Simpson
well , thank you very much , mrs. maharishi gandhi . let 's go , boy .	Homer Simpson
now here 's that bully of yours . show me your stuff .	Homer Simpson
no , no ! not like that ! like this !	Homer Simpson
see , that boy ? you did n't expect that , did you ? and neither will he .	Homer Simpson
you mean i should fight dirty , dad ?	Bart Simpson
unfortunately , son , we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own .	Homer Simpson
amen .	Bart Simpson
so the next time this bully thinks you 're gon na throw a punch , you throw a glob of mud in his eyes , and then you sock him when he 's staggering around , blinded ...	Homer Simpson
yeah !	Bart Simpson
and there 's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned .	Homer Simpson
gotcha .	Bart Simpson
and if you get the chance , get 'em right in the family jewels . that little doozy 's been a simpson trademark for generations .	Homer Simpson
thanks , pop .	Bart Simpson

ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls . contrary to what you 've just seen , war is neither glamorous nor fun . there are no winners , only losers . there are no good wars , with the following exceptions : the american revolution , world war ii , and the star wars trilogy . if you 'd like to learn more about war , there 's lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool , gory pictures . well , good night , everybody . peace , man .	Bart Simpson

bart !	Homer Simpson
just take mine . a simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure .	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah !	Bart Simpson
all right . hey , hey !	Homer Simpson
i 'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car . the iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats . the west virginia coal miner , coughing up his ...	Lisa Simpson
every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time . and we sit around like cattle , chewing our cuds , dreading the inevitable ...	Lisa Simpson
food fight !	Bart Simpson
i choose not to participate .	Lisa Simpson
in other words , to dodge the ball .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm too sad .	Lisa Simpson
come on , come on . let 's go .	Homer Simpson
in the red trunks , with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses , the undisputed champ of this house , battling bart simpson . whoopee ! whoo ! whoo ! whoo ! and in the lavender trunks , with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh , correction , humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout ...	Bart Simpson
must you do this every time ?	Homer Simpson
... homer `` the human punching bag '' simpson . boo ! boo ! hiss !	Bart Simpson
and homer is down ! three seconds , folks -- a new record !	Bart Simpson

i did n't do it . nobody saw me do it . there 's no way they can prove anything .	Bart Simpson
no , bart . this note is n't about you .	Marge Simpson
it is n't ? there must be some mistake .	Bart Simpson
hey , you 're right . this note 's about lisa .	Bart Simpson
lisa ?	Homer Simpson
`` lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad . '' well , she does n't look sad . i do n't see any tears in her eyes .	Homer Simpson
it 's not that kind of sad . i 'm sorry , dad , but you would n't understand .	Lisa Simpson
oh , sure i would , princess . i have feelings , too . you know , like `` my stomach hurts '' or `` i 'm going crazy '' . why do n't you climb up on daddy 's knee and tell him all about it ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm just wondering , what 's the point ? would it make any difference at all if i never existed ? how can we sleep at night when there 's so much suffering in the world ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... eh ... er ... eh ...	Homer Simpson
come on , lisa ... ride the homer horsey . giddiyap ! whee !	Homer Simpson
lisa , honey , why do n't we go upstairs and i 'll draw you a nice hot bath ? that helps me when i feel sad .	Marge Simpson

no . not really .	Lisa Simpson
oh . too bad . well , i certainly had fun vacuuming . maybe now i 'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub .	Bart Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
so typical of bart . all he thinks about is himself .	Lisa Simpson
hey , do n't say stuff like that about me to maggie . she 's on my side , anyway .	Bart Simpson
is not .	Lisa Simpson

i was just playing the blues ... ... dad .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to yell . go ahead -- play your blues if it 'll make you happy .	Homer Simpson
no , that 's okay , dad . i 'll just work on my fingering . unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you .	Lisa Simpson
let 's hear it .	Homer Simpson
you just clack as loud as you want . lis .	Homer Simpson
i 've got to find that sound .	Lisa Simpson

bart , go easy on me . i 'm your dad .	Homer Simpson
i am going easy on you , but you 're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic .	Bart Simpson
no , bart , no .	Homer Simpson
homer , wake up ! wake up ! oh my , here let me wipe off that drool .	Marge Simpson
you know marge , getting old is a terrible thing . i think the saddest day of my life is when i realized i could beat my dad at most things . and bart experienced that at the age of four . so why are you still awake ?	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm still trying to figure out what 's bothering lisa . i do n't know , bart 's such a handful , and maggie needs attention , but all the while our little lisa 's becoming a young woman .	Marge Simpson
oh , so that 's it . this is some kind of underwear thing .	Homer Simpson
good night , homer .	Marge Simpson
thanks , mr. murphy .	Lisa Simpson
ew ! how 'd you get a name like that ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah .	Lisa Simpson
i have problems , too .	Lisa Simpson

`` i got a bratty brother / he bugs me every day / and this mornin ' my own mother , she gave my last cupcake away ! / my dad acts like he belongs ... he belongs in the zoo / i 'm the sa ... dest kid in grade number two . ''	Lisa Simpson

now , lisa , listen to me . this is important . i want you to smile today .	Marge Simpson
but i do n't feel like smiling .	Lisa Simpson
well , it does n't matter how you feel inside , you know . it 's what shows up on the surface that counts . that 's what my mother taught me . take all your bad feelings and push them down , all the way down , past your knees , until you 're almost walking on them . and then you 'll fit in , and you 'll be invited to parties , and boys will like you ... and happiness will follow .	Marge Simpson
come on . you can do better than that .	Marge Simpson
ah , that 's my girl .	Marge Simpson

should maggie be going with them , mom ?	Lisa Simpson

there are n't any dangerous animals in this forest are there , dad ?	Bart Simpson
well , might be a few . but do n't worry about it . if you leave them alone , they 'll leave you alone .	Homer Simpson
it 's a deal .	Bart Simpson
and remember not to act afraid . animals can smell fear . and they do n't like it . besides , there 's nothing to be afraid of .	Homer Simpson

ah , cool , man . space mutants 4. drop me off ! drop me off !	Bart Simpson
no way , jose .	Marge Simpson

three jumbo cherry squishees and one double jumbo original flavor , sir .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , guys . it 's on me . share the wealth , that 's what i always say .	Bart Simpson
guys ? guys !	Bart Simpson
you ripped it off ?	Bart Simpson
but that guy founded springfield . he built our first hospital out of logs and mud . if it were n't for him all the settlers would have died in the great blizzard of forty eight .	Bart Simpson
so ... watch me hit him right between the eyes .	Bart Simpson
that one looks like the statue of our town founder , jebediah springfield .	Bart Simpson
does too . i mean without the head , of course .	Bart Simpson
you do ?	Bart Simpson
but guys , come on . do n't you remember history class ? jebediah once killed a bear with his bare hands .	Bart Simpson

dad , can i talk to you about something ?	Bart Simpson
sure , boy . what 's on your mind ?	Homer Simpson
well ... i was wondering ... how important is it to be popular ?	Bart Simpson
i 'm glad you asked , son . being popular is the most important thing in the world .	Homer Simpson
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better ?	Bart Simpson
you 're not talking about killing anyone , are you ?	Homer Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
are you ?	Homer Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
then run along you little scamp . a boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center .	Homer Simpson
what have i done ?	Bart Simpson
bart , are you all right ?	Marge Simpson
oh yeah . top of the world , ma .	Bart Simpson
well then come down for breakfast .	Marge Simpson

it 's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it .	Lisa Simpson
just a statue ? is the statue of liberty just a statue ? is the leaning tower of piza just a statue ?	Homer Simpson
uh-oh . school bus .	Bart Simpson

hi guys . what 's up ?	Bart Simpson
oh , really ?	Bart Simpson
what ? but , but yesterday did n't you say it would be cool to cut off the head and really cheese everybody off ?	Bart Simpson

shut up ... i wanted them to like me .	Bart Simpson
hey bart , where you going ?	Lisa Simpson
to my room .	Bart Simpson
why do n't you watch `` krusty the clown '' ?	Lisa Simpson
sorry , man . it 's either you or me .	Bart Simpson

jebediah obediah zachariah jedediah springfield came west in 1838 .	Bart Simpson
mom , dad .	Bart Simpson
i knew it all along .	Homer Simpson
why , bart , why ?	Marge Simpson
yeah ? why you little ...	Homer Simpson
'cause i wanted some really bad kids to like me . somehow i got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world .	Bart Simpson
where did you get a ridiculous idea like that ?	Marge Simpson
lay off the boy , marge . he 's a good kid . quit givin ' him the third degree .	Homer Simpson
homer , did you have something to do with this ?	Marge Simpson
well , maybe i am a little responsible .	Homer Simpson
a little ?	Marge Simpson
c'mon , son . let 's take the head thing back to the authorities .	Homer Simpson
you know , bart , when i was your age , i pulled a few boners , but i think you 'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half ... oh , oh .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , right ...	Bart Simpson
well , that 's my story . and if you still want to tear apart this young sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation , i await your wrath .	Bart Simpson

hmm . good advice .	Homer Simpson
marge , may i speak to you ?	Homer Simpson

you know , i 've been thinking ... everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy 's hands get all sticky . but your jelly stays right in the middle where it 's supposed to . i do n't know how you do it . you 've just got a gift , i guess . i 've always thought so . i just never mentioned it . but it 's time you knew how i feel . i do n't believe in keeping feelings bottled up . ... goodbye , my wife .

you backstabber , you traitor , you ...	Bart Simpson
snap out of it , bart . face the facts . all those hours we spent staring at krusty , we were staring at a crook .	Lisa Simpson
look , lisa , i know krusty 's innocent . do n't ask me why . it 's just a feeling i have .	Bart Simpson

no ! do n't you get it , bart ? how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he ca n't read ?	Lisa Simpson
bart , i 'm starting to think you 're right . krusty was framed . did he have any enemies ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know , but i know someone who would : krusty 's best friend in the whole world , sideshow bob .	Bart Simpson
sideshow bob , can we ask you a few --	Bart Simpson

sideshow bob !	Lisa Simpson
come on , bart . go with the flow .	Lisa Simpson
with all our hearts !	Lisa Simpson
about a zillionth as much as i love krusty .	Bart Simpson
bart simpson , sir .	Bart Simpson
i do n't think so , sir .	Bart Simpson
true , sideshow bob , but that does n't bother me . you see , my sisters and i have been doing a little investigating , and it looks to us like krusty was framed .	Bart Simpson
well , the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the kwik-e-mart . but krusty could n't go near the thing . not with his pacemaker .	Bart Simpson
well , maybe . but , get this , krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the springfield review of books .	Bart Simpson
yeah , i guess those are kinda funny .	Bart Simpson
and shot you out of a cannon .	Bart Simpson
wait a minute ! you did it !	Bart Simpson
attention , fellow children . krusty did n't rob that store . sideshow bob framed him and i got proof .	Bart Simpson
see that ? krusty wore big floppy shoes but he 's got little feet , like all good-hearted people .	Bart Simpson
sideshow bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet .	Bart Simpson
take him away , boys .	Bart Simpson
krusty , i 'm man enough to admit i was wrong , and i 'm sorry i fingered you in court . i sincerely hope that the horrible stories i heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated .	Homer Simpson
yes , sir .	Bart Simpson

hello , everyone . you know , halloween is a very strange holiday . personally , i do n't understand it . kids worshiping ghosts , pretending to be devils ... things on t.v . that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers . things like the following half hour . nothing seems to bother my kids , but tonight 's show , which i totally wash my hands of , is really scary , so if you have sensitive children , maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight , instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow . thanks for your attention .	Marge Simpson
oooo ! what a haul this year . i love halloween .	Homer Simpson
wait a minute . let 's see what the kids are up to .	Homer Simpson

what ?	Lisa Simpson
anything !	Bart Simpson
surely --	Homer Simpson
though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou --	Homer Simpson
-- art sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -- tell me ... tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's plutonian shore !	Homer Simpson

get thee back into the tempest and the night 's plutonian shore ! oh , leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken ! leave my loneliness unbroken ! -- quit the bust above my door ! take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door !	Homer Simpson
take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door !	Homer Simpson
why you little -- !	Homer Simpson
come back here now , raven	Homer Simpson
nevermore . nevermore . nevermore . nevermore . nevermore .	Bart Simpson
lisa , that was n't scary . not even for a poem .	Bart Simpson
well , it was written in 1845. maybe people were easier to scare back then .	Lisa Simpson
well yeah , like when you look at `` friday the 13th , part i , '' it 's pretty tame by today 's standards .	Bart Simpson
children , bedtime .	Marge Simpson
i guess i 'll have no trouble gettin ' to sleep tonight .	Bart Simpson
oh no , marge . come on , please .	Homer Simpson
homer , i am not sleeping with the lights on . they 're just children 's stories . they ca n't hurt you .	Marge Simpson
oh ... oh , i hate halloween .	Homer Simpson
not yet , sir .	Lisa Simpson
my brother 's using worms but i who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish , am using nothing .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm bart simpson . who the hell are you ?	Bart Simpson
well , this is my day and we do , sir .	Bart Simpson
all right ! we eat tonight !	Bart Simpson
well leave it to good old mary bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation .	Marge Simpson
mary bailey . well , if i was governor , i 'd sure find better things to do with my time .	Homer Simpson
like getting washington 's birthday and lincoln 's birthday back as separate paid holidays . president 's day ! pfft . what a rip-off ! i bust my butt day in and day out --	Homer Simpson
you 're late for work , homer .	Marge Simpson
so ... someone will punch in for me .	Homer Simpson
try not to spill anything , dad .	Lisa Simpson
keep those mutants comin ' , homer .	Bart Simpson
i 'll mutant you .	Homer Simpson
oh , man . plain cake donuts ? thanks for taking all the fancies , guys . why ca n't i ever get here on time ?	Homer Simpson
uh , uh , just resting my eyes .	Homer Simpson
ah ! uh ... i 'm just resting my eyes . holy moly ! nine-thirty .	Homer Simpson
hello , marge . sorry i did n't call but it 's been a madhouse down here ... yeah , these twelve hour days are killin ' me .	Homer Simpson

sorry , sir . it 's just me , homer simpson . is everything all right ?	Homer Simpson
uh ... uh yes , sir .	Homer Simpson
ooooh , cushy .	Homer Simpson
well , nobody 's perfect .	Homer Simpson
you know , i was just telling the wife that if i was governor , i 'd do things a lot differently .	Homer Simpson
i bet you could afford it , though .	Homer Simpson
uh ... do n't get me wrong . i mean you 're an honest man . i just meant that you could afford to run for governor , if you felt like it . 'course i 'm just rambling because ... uh ... because you keep staring at me like that , but , but it 's true . i mean , if you were governor , you could decide what 's safe and what is n't .	Homer Simpson
where are we going , sir ?	Homer Simpson
if it 's on the way , could you drop me off at my house ?	Homer Simpson
well , he 's got my vote .	Homer Simpson
homer , we 're a mary bailey family .	Marge Simpson
mary bailey is n't going to fire me if i do n't vote for her . i 'm for monty burns .	Homer Simpson
oooo , a political discussion at our table . i feel like a kennedy .	Lisa Simpson
well , frankly , i do n't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey , the most beloved governor our great state has ever known .	Marge Simpson
i wonder if he 's going to say anything about that horrible fish .	Marge Simpson
oh , marge . what 's the big deal ? i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion , you did n't even know how many eyes a fish had .	Homer Simpson
i hope burns and i can count on your support , honey .	Homer Simpson
homer ... i 'm a bailey booster .	Marge Simpson
is your boss governor yet ?	Bart Simpson
not yet , son . not yet .	Homer Simpson
ah ... great toast , marge . hmmm . oh , by the way , the night before the election mr. burns is coming over for dinner .	Homer Simpson
what !	Marge Simpson
and some reporters and camera crews , but you do n't need to feed them .	Homer Simpson
cool man ! a media circus .	Bart Simpson
absolutely not !	Marge Simpson
come on , marge .	Homer Simpson
huh uh . i 'm going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night .	Marge Simpson
kids , please leave the room . i do n't want you to see this .	Homer Simpson
uh oh .	Bart Simpson
please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please .	Homer Simpson
`` mr. burns , your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train . why are you so popular ? ''	Lisa Simpson
hmmm . well as long as i 'm asking something , can i ask him to assuage my fears that he 's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable ?	Lisa Simpson
well i think the non-card question is a valid one .	Marge Simpson
marge ! do n't worry . my daughter 's very bright , i 'm sure she 'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow .	Homer Simpson
marge , get back in bed .	Homer Simpson
no , i 'm just fine right here .	Marge Simpson
what 's wrong ? i just want to snuggle .	Homer Simpson
well , i do n't feel like snuggling .	Marge Simpson
what 's that got to do with it ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't want to snuggle with anybody who 's not letting me express myself .	Marge Simpson
but you do get to express yourself . in the lovely home you keep , and the food you serve .	Homer Simpson
okay , homer . fair enough . you got it ! all right ! good ! that 's it . that 's how i 'm gon na express myself . that 's right . goodnight .	Marge Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
hey ! hello , handsome !	Homer Simpson
whoa ! he 's here !	Bart Simpson
bad dog ! bad neighbor dog ! here , let me help you up , mr. burns .	Homer Simpson
are you all right , mr. burns ?	Homer Simpson
bart , would you like to say grace ?	Homer Simpson
dear god , we paid for all this stuff ourselves , so thanks for nothin ' .	Bart Simpson
`` you know , mr. burns , my family and i feel that taxes are too high . where do you stand on this highly controversial issue ? ''	Homer Simpson
i was only reading what the card ...	Homer Simpson
yes , sir . a very inane one . mr. burns , your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train . why are you so popular ?	Lisa Simpson
oh mom , that felt awful .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry , dear . it will all be over soon .	Marge Simpson
but mom , we 've become the tools of evil .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , you 're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt .	Marge Simpson
all right ! three eyed fish !	Bart Simpson
can i have your plate , mr. burns ?	Marge Simpson
homer ... homer ... make them stop .	Marge Simpson
uh , mr. burns ... uh , mr. burns ...	Homer Simpson
mr. burns , i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish .	Lisa Simpson
uh oh . you 're busted , dad .	Bart Simpson
oh . my dreams will go unfulfilled ! oh no . i do n't like the sound of that one bit . that means i have nothing to hope for . marge , make it better . please . ca n't you make it better , huh ?	Homer Simpson
homer , when a man 's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert , occasional snuggling , and sleeping till noon on weekends , no one man can destroy them .	Marge Simpson
hey , you did it !	Homer Simpson
aw , barney .	Homer Simpson
look , there 's only one thing worse than being a loser . it 's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser . and i never want that to happen to me .	Homer Simpson
well , okay . it all started on `` nuclear plant employees , spouses , and no more than three children night , '' down at springfield stadium .	Homer Simpson
you know , boy , some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues , one day .	Homer Simpson
what ? are n't we gon na see any washed-up major leaguers ?	Bart Simpson
sure , we get a nice mix here .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer 's night than the old ball yard . there 's just the green grass of the outfield , the crushed brick of the infield , and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , honey , you 're forgetting the beer . it comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here .	Homer Simpson
i hope you 'll space out the tubs this year , homer .	Marge Simpson
what are you getting at ?	Homer Simpson
well , last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire .	Marge Simpson
marge , this ticket does n't just give me a seat , it also gives me the right - no , the duty , to make a complete ass of myself .	Homer Simpson
uh ... simp-sons , sir .	Homer Simpson
oh , that 's okay . the baby 's name is n't important . let 's go , marge .	Homer Simpson
oh , wow -- there 's flash bailor ! i got ta get his autograph ! he used to be a star !	Bart Simpson
hey , flash ! will ya sign my ball ?	Bart Simpson
lousy , washed-up , broken-down ... old tub of guts ... who does he think he is anyway ...	Bart Simpson
what 's the matter , boy ?	Homer Simpson
he would n't sign my ball .	Bart Simpson
well , he 's a fine role model . bart , give me that ball !	Marge Simpson
here you go , bart .	Marge Simpson
`` hmmm , springfield kozy kort motel , room 26 ... how 'bout it ? -- flash . ''	Bart Simpson
wow ! flash bailor came on to my wife ! you 've still got the magic , marge .	Homer Simpson
hey , dad , look , you 're on jumbovision !	Bart Simpson
whoa !	Homer Simpson
hey everybody ! how you doin ' ? look at me ! i 'm homer simpson ! heh ... heh .	Homer Simpson
homer ... homer ... x.y.z .	Marge Simpson
examine my zipper ? why ? whoops !	Homer Simpson
thanks , everybody .	Homer Simpson
what a lame-o !	Bart Simpson
hey , burns ! hey , `` rag arm '' !	Homer Simpson
you throw like my sister , man !	Bart Simpson
yeah , you throw like me .	Lisa Simpson
let 's go now ... sa-winggg , batter !	Homer Simpson
we want a pitcher / not a belly itcher !	Bart Simpson
we want a catcher / not a belly scratcher !	Lisa Simpson
oh , no . marge , sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year , and it 's ruined ! of all the lousy , rotten ... this stinks ...	Homer Simpson
all this means is you ca n't wave your fanny in public .	Marge Simpson
rub it in .	Homer Simpson
delicious frosty beer . fat lot of good that does me , sitting next to old man burns .	Homer Simpson
now , homer .	Marge Simpson
me , sir ? oh , no . not a chance . only idiots drink beer .	Homer Simpson
ohhh . well , if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer , maybe i 'm all turned around on the subject . wait a minute , we 're not having a drug test tomorrow , are we ?	Homer Simpson
good one , sir .	Homer Simpson
little baby batter / ca n't control his bladder !	Homer Simpson
will you shut up , i 'm trying to think of a name .	Homer Simpson
do n't mind if i do .	Homer Simpson
all right , burnsie .	Homer Simpson
c'mon ! all we need is a grand slam .	Homer Simpson
what 's wrong with you people ? let 's show some spirit ! come on , get up !	Homer Simpson
your team needs you ! c'mon ! ! !	Homer Simpson
as i got up in front of them , i felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol . it was the intoxication of being a public spectacle .	Homer Simpson
i thank you . you 're too kind . glad you enjoyed it , but i ca n't take all the credit . the batter did his part , too .	Homer Simpson
m -- me ? a mascot for a bush league team ?	Homer Simpson
i should have slept on it . or at least stared blankly for a while . perhaps if i 'd been unable to think of a nickname , all our lives might have been spared .	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm ready to punch in .	Homer Simpson
oh , oh . hey , cool , man .	Bart Simpson
our lives have taken an odd turn .	Lisa Simpson
did the team ask you to dress like that , homer ?	Marge Simpson
nope , this was my own bright idea . c'mon , we got ta hurry . do n't fill up on those vegetables , kids . save room for your nachos .	Homer Simpson
for the first time in my life , people were n't laughing at me , they were laughing towards me .	Homer Simpson
a simpson on a t-shirt . i never thought i 'd see the day .	Marge Simpson
oooh , boogie , boogie , boogie , boogie , boogie . woo , boogie , boogie , boogie , boogie , boogie , boogie .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah ? and where might that be ? oh .	Homer Simpson
helen , i 'm in a caribbean mood tonight . how 'bout giving me `` baby elephant walk '' with a little reggae kinda beat ?	Homer Simpson
you wanted to see me , `` tex '' ?	Homer Simpson
oh , oh , oh , i get it . you ca n't fire the players , so you fire the mascot . you make me sick .	Homer Simpson
me ? in the majors ?	Homer Simpson
wait a minute , capital city has a mascot . the greatest mascot there is : the capital city `` goofball '' .	Homer Simpson
i 'll say !	Homer Simpson
because they might say no .	Homer Simpson
this was the biggest decision the simpsons ever faced . i should 've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife .	Homer Simpson
i should n't have called her that . bite my tongue . bite my tongue . oooh .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't leave springfield . i was born here and i thought i would die here .	Lisa Simpson
it wo n't be so bad . you 'll die someplace else .	Homer Simpson
well , what am i supposed to do about friends ?	Bart Simpson
phfft . you 'll make new and better friends .	Homer Simpson
but , dad . we 're simple people with simple values . capital city is too big and too complex . everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us .	Lisa Simpson
homer , i 'd be lying if i did n't say that this scares me a little . but we all have a calling , a reason the almighty put us on this earth . and yours might be to dance on dugouts .	Marge Simpson
you mean -- ?	Homer Simpson
let 's do it , homer !	Marge Simpson
yeah , let 's blow this pop stand and never look back .	Bart Simpson
whatever does n't kill me can only make me stronger .	Lisa Simpson
it 's not that simple . i 've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence .	Homer Simpson
that 's right , ned .	Homer Simpson
oh , knock it off , flanders ! do n't start blubbering on me . i 'm gon na miss you too ... not .	Homer Simpson
come on , milhouse . this way we 'll be friends forever .	Bart Simpson
i 'm gon na miss you , spit brother .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better , my leaving would actually have meant something .	Lisa Simpson
well , we have one quick stop and then it 's on to capital city .	Marge Simpson
... some may say that i have been given a bad break in life -- little education , bald as a cue ball , ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today , as i leave for capital city , i consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth !	Homer Simpson
with the fickle fans already forgetting me , i was ready to take the biggest step of my life .	Homer Simpson
well kids , there it is , capital city .	Homer Simpson
look ! the crosstown bridge !	Marge Simpson
wow !	Bart Simpson
wow !	Homer Simpson
the pennyloafer !	Lisa Simpson
kids , look ! street crime !	Homer Simpson
wow ! that 's service !	Homer Simpson
look , it 's tony bennett !	Marge Simpson
oh , well , we 're all out , homer .	Marge Simpson
fourth street and d !	Marge Simpson
the duff brewery !	Homer Simpson
capital city -- yeah !	Lisa Simpson
awww . come to bed , homie .	Marge Simpson
sorry , honey . i 'm just a little nervous .	Homer Simpson
we would talk about it always . for the first time in our lives , marge fell asleep before i did .	Homer Simpson
okay , here are your tickets . they 're supposed to be good . you 're sitting with the player 's wives . and do n't forget to cheer for me .	Homer Simpson
see you after the game , when you 're a big star .	Marge Simpson
bart was strangely quiet . later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me . that would n't last .	Homer Simpson
wow .	Homer Simpson
omigod ! i do n't believe it . it 's really you , the capital city `` goofball . ''	Homer Simpson
wow , the fifth .	Homer Simpson
right , mr. goofball .	Homer Simpson
well , i get up , i dance , i spell out the name of the city ... all to the tune of baby elephant walk .	Homer Simpson
let 's see . upper , upper , upper mezzanine . hmmm . yes , these must be ours .	Marge Simpson
these seats stink !	Bart Simpson
you 'd think the player 's wives would be a little closer to the action .	Marge Simpson
who'd 've thought it ? a free ticket to a big league park but i was too tense to enjoy the game . every ounce of concentration i possessed was focused on the task at hand .	Homer Simpson
oooh , red hots .	Homer Simpson
mmm , these do taste better at the ballpark . uh oh .	Homer Simpson
there he is !	Lisa Simpson
i was graceful . i was witty . brother , i was somethin ' .	Homer Simpson
but they did n't care .	Homer Simpson
what 's with these people ? why are they sitting on their hands ?	Bart Simpson
mom , what 's he doing wrong ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know .	Marge Simpson
it was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark .	Homer Simpson
the only applause i got was for dragging my carcass out of there .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess it 's back to good old springfield .	Bart Simpson
would you like some fruit juice ?	Marge Simpson
but i ca n't go back ! not after i 've seen the bright lights of capital city . i 'll wither and die like a hothouse flower .	Lisa Simpson
now stop it you two . and do n't look too down . i 'm sure this is hard enough for your father .	Marge Simpson
what a family .	Homer Simpson
my wife and kids stood by me . on the way home i realized how little that helped .	Homer Simpson
so that 's it . the costume 's buried now . as my son would say , i 'm one sad ape-like dude .	Homer Simpson
hey , you guys are hanging on my every word . i 've become the center of attention .	Homer Simpson
okay . i wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular .	Homer Simpson
bust my hump all week ... stupid grass ... supposed to be the boy 's job .	Homer Simpson
now , now , homer . bart 's busy working on his science project .	Marge Simpson
you heard the lady , homer . so please mow quietly . genius at work .	Bart Simpson
one o'clock -- still just a potato. , one oclock -- still just a potato,7	Bart Simpson
h'lo , flanders .	Homer Simpson
who told ? marge ! beer me !	Homer Simpson
crabgrass ? what are you talking about ? where ?	Homer Simpson
there 's nothing wrong with crabgrass ! it just has a bad name , that 's all . everyone would love it if it had a cute name like ... uh ... elfgrass .	Homer Simpson
marge ! where 's the duff ?	Homer Simpson
do n't toy with me , woman .	Homer Simpson
well , uh , okay . what the heck , i 've earned a little break .	Homer Simpson
holy moly ! it 's ... it 's ... beautiful !	Homer Simpson
well , we 've only been neighbors , what ? uh , one , two , three , four ... eight years .	Homer Simpson
yeah , yeah , yeah , but are n't we forgetting something , flanders ?	Homer Simpson
well , beggars ca n't be choosy .	Homer Simpson
all right , knock it off !	Homer Simpson
you 've been rubbing my nose in it since i got here . your family is better than my family . your beer comes from farther away than my beer . you and your son like each other . your wife 's butt is higher than my wife 's butt . you make me sick !	Homer Simpson
i would n't stay on a bet !	Homer Simpson
one for the road .	Homer Simpson
homie , quit tossing .	Marge Simpson
play it where it lays , homer .	Bart Simpson
sorry , marge . but it 's just that i 'm still steamed up about that jerk flanders . lousy ... bragging ... know-it-all ... show-off ...	Homer Simpson
what exactly did he say ?	Marge Simpson
get this . he said ... he said ... well , it was n't so much what he said , it was how he said it !	Homer Simpson
well , how did he say it ?	Marge Simpson
well ... he ...	Homer Simpson
was he angry ?	Marge Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
was he rude ?	Marge Simpson
okay , okay . it was n't how he said it either , but the message was loud and clear ... our family stinks !	Homer Simpson
homer , i 'm your best friend , but i 've got ta say , i 've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor .	Marge Simpson
oh , he 's perfect now , is he ?	Homer Simpson
well , he 's not perfect , but he is very ...	Marge Simpson
no , no , marge . do n't backpedal . you were right the first time . he 's perfect . perfect in every way .	Homer Simpson
i 'm just gon na go take a walk around the block to calm down . i got a little excited . i 'm not perfect ... like ned flanders .	Homer Simpson
flanders !	Homer Simpson
dear neighbor ...	Homer Simpson
you are my brother . i love you and yet i feel a great sadness in my bosom .	Homer Simpson
wait ! wait ! there 's more ...	Homer Simpson
i think it 's terrible . a man opens his heart and you make fun of him .	Marge Simpson
`` neighbors forever . oh , no ! ned flanders . ''	Homer Simpson
what a sap !	Bart Simpson
read the bosom part again , dad .	Lisa Simpson
now , just a minute .	Marge Simpson
bosom !	Bart Simpson
bart !	Marge Simpson
huh ?	Bart Simpson
i wish this family was as close as the flanders .	Marge Simpson
okay , okay , all right , all right . she 's right ! let 's do something together . what does everyone say to some miniature golf , followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes ?	Homer Simpson
all right !	Bart Simpson
hmmm . i was going to wash my hair .	Marge Simpson
and i 'm studying for the math fair . if i win , i 'll bring home a brand new protractor .	Lisa Simpson
too bad we do n't live on a farm . let 's go , boy .	Homer Simpson
fore !	Homer Simpson
heh , heh , heh heh ...	Bart Simpson
but i got it in the middle !	Homer Simpson
that was just a practice shot , boy .	Homer Simpson

i know , i know . i can still make this for five . come on , baby , pleeze pleeze go in . pleeze .	Homer Simpson
flanders ! what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
get bent .	Bart Simpson
that shot is impossible ! jack nicholson himself could n't make it .	Homer Simpson
luck .	Homer Simpson
final score : bart , forty-one . homer ... let 's see , six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six ...	Bart Simpson
never mind !	Homer Simpson
wow ! free balloons for everyone who enters !	Bart Simpson
yeah , he 's entering and what 's more , he 's going to win , are n't you , boy ?	Homer Simpson
i guess it 's possible .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ! well i think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week .	Homer Simpson
come on , boy .	Homer Simpson
but dad , i 've never won anything in my life .	Bart Simpson
son , this is the only time i 'm ever gon na say this . it is not okay to lose .	Homer Simpson
you brought food ...	Marge Simpson
stay , stay . good dog . now , keep your head down .	Homer Simpson
no , not you . i 'm talking to the boy . keep your head down . follow through ...	Homer Simpson
okay , that did n't work . this time move your head and do n't follow through .	Homer Simpson
oh , man .	Bart Simpson
what 're you doing ? that putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player , what a violin is to the guy tha ... the violin guy . now , c'mon , give your putter a name .	Homer Simpson
what ?	Bart Simpson
come on , give it a name .	Homer Simpson
mr. putter .	Bart Simpson
do you wan na try a little harder , son ? come on , give it a girl 's name .	Homer Simpson
mom .	Bart Simpson
your putter 's name is charlene !	Homer Simpson
why ?	Bart Simpson
it just is . that 's why .	Homer Simpson
now , this is a picture of your enemy , todd flanders . every day i want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and charlene annihilate him .	Homer Simpson
who 's charlene ?	Bart Simpson
i 'll show you who charlene is ! now start hating !	Homer Simpson
homer , i could n't help overhearing you warp bart 's mind .	Marge Simpson
and ?	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm worried that you 're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament .	Marge Simpson
but , marge , this is our big chance to show up the flanderses .	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm sure it is , but why do we want to do that ?	Marge Simpson
because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad . and i 'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves .	Homer Simpson
hi , bart . what 're you doing ?	Lisa Simpson

homer ! i 'm trying to work !	Marge Simpson
oh . what are you doing ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons . i do n't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before .	Marge Simpson
what kind of warped human being would find that funny ?	Marge Simpson
heh , heh , heh .	Homer Simpson
this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , but what are ya gon na do ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do . i 'm going to write a letter .	Marge Simpson
dear purveyors of senseless violence : i know this may sound silly at first ...	Marge Simpson
... but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way ...	Marge Simpson
... please try to tone down the psychotic violence ...	Marge Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
`` ... in your otherwise fine programming . yours truly , marge simpson . ''	Marge Simpson
... and the horse i rode in on ! ?	Marge Simpson
everybody 's looking at us , marge .	Homer Simpson
well , that 's what we want them to do , homer .	Marge Simpson
oh . well , how long are we going to have to be doing this ?	Homer Simpson
well , i 've never changed the world before , so i do n't know how long it takes exactly . but if enough people take an interest ...	Marge Simpson
snuh !	Marge Simpson
it stands for `` springfieldians	Marge Simpson
for nonviolence , understanding and helping . ''	Marge Simpson
i 've started a crusade against cartoon violence .	Marge Simpson
i can protect my own children .	Marge Simpson
but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four .	Marge Simpson
that reminds me . i 've got ta get over to milhouse 's and ... uh ... play sports .	Bart Simpson
all right .	Marge Simpson
and i 'm going over to janey 's again . we 're going to be ... um ... making the most of our childhood years .	Lisa Simpson
have fun .	Marge Simpson
we will .	Lisa Simpson
oh , oh , baby !	Bart Simpson
and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these ?	Marge Simpson
the answer is all around you .	Marge Simpson
how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week ?	Marge Simpson
i did n't know they still made tv dinners this bad .	Homer Simpson
after dinner , can i watch cartoons ?	Bart Simpson

hmmm , sure . oh , dear . i ca n't . i 've got three protest rallies tomorrow .	Marge Simpson
twenty million women in the world and i had to marry jane fonda .	Homer Simpson
what do we want ?	Marge Simpson
when do we want it ?	Marge Simpson
what do we want ?	Marge Simpson
her group	Marge Simpson
substantially-less	Marge Simpson
violence-in children's-program-ming .	Marge Simpson
krusty	Marge Simpson

please stop . please . be quiet .	Marge Simpson
oh , please . all right . i 'm trying to earn a living here . all right ! stop ! stop !	Marge Simpson
you know , some of these stories are pretty good . i never know mice lived such interesting lives .	Homer Simpson
so much needless brutality . i do n't know if i 'm having any impact at all .	Marge Simpson
take that you dumb squirrel .	Homer Simpson
mmmmmmmph !	Marge Simpson
where do they get their ideas ?	Homer Simpson
what is it ? what ? `` smartline ? '' yes , i 've heard of your late-night panel discussion show . well , i 'd love to .	Marge Simpson
there she is !	Lisa Simpson
me and the guys went fishing . almost caught a catfish this big .	Bart Simpson
excuse me . excuse me . he was addressing me .	Marge Simpson
excuse me . there is ! i think that it 's a bad influence on children .	Marge Simpson
ohhh .	Marge Simpson
yes . i 'd like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel . thank you .	Marge Simpson
hello ?	Marge Simpson
yes .	Marge Simpson
yes ?	Marge Simpson
well ... what 's the problem you 're having ?	Marge Simpson
huh huh .	Marge Simpson
oh dear !	Marge Simpson
well ... let 's see ... oh ! could n't itchy share his pie with scratchy ? then they would both have pie .	Marge Simpson
borrowed ?	Bart Simpson
one thousand dollars .	Homer Simpson
oh , sorry .	Homer Simpson
i was watching that .	Homer Simpson
it 's time for krusty .	Marge Simpson
you mean we can watch cartoons again , mom ?	Bart Simpson
yes , dear . all you want .	Marge Simpson
all right !	Lisa Simpson
turn it up !	Bart Simpson
itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge .	Lisa Simpson
i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing .	Marge Simpson
i think it sucks .	Bart Simpson
... oh , hey , thank you , maggie .	Homer Simpson
are n't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons ?	Marge Simpson
nah . come on , lis .	Bart Simpson
maybe there 's something else to do on this planet .	Lisa Simpson
so what did you kids do today ?	Marge Simpson
sit down , boy !	Homer Simpson
and janey and i went bird watching . we saw a grackle .	Lisa Simpson
that 's nice dear .	Marge Simpson
come on , lis . let 's go finish our soapbox racers .	Bart Simpson
okay . may we please be excused ?	Lisa Simpson
sure .	Marge Simpson
wow . what great kids . this is the golden age , marge . and the parents of springfield owe it all to you .	Homer Simpson
i did n't really expect things to change this much .	Marge Simpson
well , i always knew you 'd change the world , for the better .	Homer Simpson
marge , get the door .	Homer Simpson
what in the world ?	Marge Simpson
hmmm , but that 's michelangelo 's david . it 's a masterpiece !	Marge Simpson
but i like that statue .	Marge Simpson
really ? great !	Homer Simpson
i 'm not . i think everyone in springfield should see it .	Marge Simpson
hmmm ... yes and no .	Marge Simpson
well ... i guess i ca n't , which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons .	Marge Simpson
um , i do n't know . i guess one person can make a difference , but most of the time , they probably should n't .	Marge Simpson
well , there he is ... michelangelo 's dave .	Homer Simpson
david .	Marge Simpson
oh . what 's wrong , marge ?	Homer Simpson
oh , homie . here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they 're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other .	Marge Simpson
hey , do n't worry marge , pretty soon every boy and girl in springfield elementary school is gon na come and see this thing .	Homer Simpson
really , why ?	Marge Simpson
they 're forcing 'em .	Homer Simpson
aw , well is n't that nice .	Marge Simpson
hey , cool . i 'm dead .	Bart Simpson
great grandpa simpson !	Bart Simpson
snowball !	Bart Simpson
i 'm bart simpson . who the hell are you ?	Bart Simpson
hey , i 'm innocent , man !	Bart Simpson

um ... say ... is there anything i can do to avoid coming back here ?	Bart Simpson
oh , okay . see you later then .	Bart Simpson
yessir !	Bart Simpson
he 's awake !	Homer Simpson
oh , bart ! we thought for a minute you 'd gone away from us .	Marge Simpson
i did go away , mom ! i was miles and miles and miles away , writhing in agony in the pits of hell . and you were there ! and you ! and you ! and you ! you i 've never seen before .	Bart Simpson
hey , yeah ! who are you ? i saw you chasing bart 's ambulance ...	Homer Simpson
ooo , classy .	Homer Simpson
well , the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss . and besides , the doctor says it 's just a bump on the head and a broken toe . nothing serious .	Homer Simpson
wow ...	Homer Simpson
excuse me , mr. hutz . are you a shyster ?	Lisa Simpson
mr. hutz , this is hardly the time or place to discuss this .	Marge Simpson
hello , dr. hibbert .	Lisa Simpson
ow ! quit it !	Bart Simpson
ow ! quit it !	Bart Simpson
is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably , doctor ?	Marge Simpson
hmmm .	Marge Simpson
yeah . if i was n't so spineless , i 'd march into mr. burns ' office right now and ...	Homer Simpson
uh-oh ...	Homer Simpson
nice to meet you too , sir .	Homer Simpson
a hundred bucks ?	Homer Simpson
w-well ... it 's a v-very generous offer , sir . but ... his medical bills alone ...	Homer Simpson
you do n't have to do that , mr. burns . i can throw myself out .	Homer Simpson
hey ! lionel hutz ...	Homer Simpson
you sure have got some education , mr. hutz .	Homer Simpson
fifty percent ?	Homer Simpson
well ... i dunno ... you and i might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is .	Homer Simpson
whoo ooo ! i stand corrected . a million bucks is a-okay !	Homer Simpson
oh !	Marge Simpson
whiplash ! oh no !	Homer Simpson
am i gon na die ?	Bart Simpson
yes , son .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
no , of course you 're not going to die . everything 's fine !	Homer Simpson
will i ever play baseball again ?	Bart Simpson
no !	Homer Simpson
but i played baseball this morning !	Bart Simpson
that 's right , he did . excuse me , but dr. hibbert has been our family physician for years , and he thought bart was fine .	Marge Simpson
oh , dr. hibbert from johns hopkins medical school ?	Homer Simpson
just give me a ticket .	Homer Simpson
fine .	Bart Simpson
i am in constant pain .	Bart Simpson
dad , may i please make an observation ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , what ? what is it ?	Homer Simpson
i think this is all a charade to make bart look more injured than he really is .	Lisa Simpson
well , maybe lisa does have a point . i do n't mind you boys doing this in the living room , but in court does n't bart have to tell the truth ?	Marge Simpson
ah , you mean like i 'm dead ? yeah , sure .	Bart Simpson
maybe .	Bart Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
yes , sir . it was a beautiful sunday afternoon . i was playing in my wholesome childlike way , little realizing that i was about to be struck down by the luxury car of death .	Bart Simpson
luckily , i was not killed that day . although sometimes i wish i had been .	Bart Simpson
i did n't know you liked animals .	Marge Simpson
do n't mind if i do .	Homer Simpson
mr. burns , are you trying to get me drunk ?	Homer Simpson
you mean duke it out ?	Homer Simpson
five hundred thousand dollars !	Homer Simpson
goodness !	Marge Simpson
well , marge , what do you think ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't know . maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us .	Marge Simpson
what do you think , homer ?	Marge Simpson
i 'll tell you what i think . i think he thinks i 'm an idiot . the only reason he 's offering us this is because he knows he 's gon na lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million .	Homer Simpson
five hundred thousand dollars . i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars .	Homer Simpson
homer , what 's happened to you ? all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --	Marge Simpson
do you know what i 'd settle for if it was up to me ? bart 's medical bills and an apology !	Marge Simpson
oh , the truth !	Homer Simpson
yes , he 's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother . he 's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , but my mother always said , `` if you ca n't say anything nice , do n't say anything at all . ''	Marge Simpson
will that hold up in court ?	Homer Simpson
well , to be honest , he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better . and he mispronounced words that even i know , like abdomen . and his office was dirty . now that i think about it , i 'm not sure he 's even a doctor .	Marge Simpson
well , i do n't know how intense it was ...	Marge Simpson
... but , well , i guess he did miss three days of school --	Marge Simpson
... although he does n't really like school all that much ,	Marge Simpson
... so i guess that may not count as anguish .	Marge Simpson
it was a little hard on me having him around the house	Marge Simpson
... all that time .	Marge Simpson
well , we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash ...	Marge Simpson
i suppose if he 'd been able to do it that week , we might have given him the five dollars .	Marge Simpson
um-hmm .	Marge Simpson
oh , marge .	Homer Simpson
a million dollars . my wife cost me a million dollars .	Homer Simpson
homer , would you like some more macaroni and cheese ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman . no , thank you .	Homer Simpson
some string beans ?	Marge Simpson
no i do n't want any string beans either you two-timing , back-stabbing . uh oh i better answer . no , thank you .	Homer Simpson
some celery with cream cheese on it ?	Marge Simpson
no , thank you .	Homer Simpson
you know what would 've really been cool ? if we got that million bucks .	Bart Simpson
bart , please .	Marge Simpson
what ? we could have bought tons of great stuff , mom ... maids , a pool , fancy sweaters ... stop me if i 'm wrong .	Bart Simpson
marge , dear . would it be all right if i went over to moe 's for a drink ?	Homer Simpson
sure .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know if i 'll ever come back here . goodnight .	Homer Simpson
my woman 's intuition is telling me something ... i wonder what ... oh my god .	Marge Simpson
well , that 's it . i guess this is the class i 'm gon na die in .	Homer Simpson
moe , i wish he 'd shut up .	Homer Simpson
hey , hey , guys . knock it off . it 's just my wife .	Homer Simpson
my name is marge .	Marge Simpson
homer , i 'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing .	Marge Simpson
oh , marge ...	Homer Simpson
we 've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- i mean , i know this is different than that time i washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket , but i --	Marge Simpson
no , no , no . you think this is about money ? well , it 's not . it 's worse , marge . i 'm afraid that from now on when i look at you , i 'm not gon na see the wife by my side or the mother of my children . i 'm just gon na see the dame who blew my one big chance .	Homer Simpson
what are you saying , homer ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm saying ... she 's been your wife for ten years , you 've had three children together , it 's time to be honest with her . i 'm not sure i love you anymore .	Homer Simpson
but do n't worry . i 'll never let on . i 'll still do all the bed stuff . maybe it wo n't be so bad .	Homer Simpson
oh my lord . well , i do n't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore . i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out .	Marge Simpson
homer , look at me .	Marge Simpson
alright , alright , look at her if it 'll make her shut up . start with the feet , still angry ? good , good homer , good . this is tough , need refreshment . ahh , good old trustworthy beer , my love for you will never die . alright , alright , got ta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her .	Homer Simpson
oh , who am i kidding ? i love you more than ever .	Homer Simpson
i love you too !	Marge Simpson
sorry to scare you like that , babe .	Homer Simpson
is it done yet ? is it done yet ?	Homer Simpson
your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds , homer .	Marge Simpson
is n't there anything faster than a microwave ? four , three , two , one , ping !	Homer Simpson

yum . i 've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it , lisa .	Homer Simpson

what are you getting at ?	Homer Simpson
well , you 're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded , try new things , live life to the ...	Lisa Simpson
what are you talking about ? nobody 's trying to teach you that .	Homer Simpson
shut up , boy .	Homer Simpson
well , maybe lisa 's right . tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner .	Marge Simpson
tomorrow night ! ? friday ! ? pork chop night ! ? marge , we have n't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87 .	Homer Simpson
friday night , pork chops . from cradle to grave ... etched in stone in god 's library somewhere ...	Lisa Simpson
okay , okay , okay , okay . where do you want to go ?	Homer Simpson
anywhere but hamburgers , pizza or fried chicken .	Lisa Simpson
fine . we 'll go to mars .	Homer Simpson
there 's that new sushi restaurant on elm street .	Marge Simpson
sushi ? hey , maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground ... but , is n't that raw fish ?	Bart Simpson
as usual , the playground has the facts right , but missed the point entirely . sushi is considered quite a delicacy .	Lisa Simpson
please , homer . ca n't we try it ?	Marge Simpson
no !	Homer Simpson
please , dad . this argument humiliates us both .	Lisa Simpson
if i said no the first time , what makes you think i 'm gon na say yes the second time ?	Homer Simpson
nothing , but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time .	Lisa Simpson
oh , try me .	Homer Simpson
please , dad .	Lisa Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
please , dad .	Lisa Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson

marge , lisa , maggie ...	Homer Simpson

excuse me . i hate to interrupt your judging me , but i wanted you to know i 've made a couple of really important decisions . number one : i 'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight 's over . and number two : i 'm not very fond of any of you .	Homer Simpson
dad , we may have saved your soul .	Lisa Simpson

marge , honey , i 've got five words to say to you . greasy joe 's bottomless bar-b-q pit .	Homer Simpson
homer , remember you promised you 'd try to limit pork to six servings a week ?	Marge Simpson
marge , i 'm only human . now look , here 's what we 're gon na do . we 'll unload the kids on patty and selma saturday night . and then we 'll eat until they kick us out of the place . just like old times .	Homer Simpson
saturday night ? i 'm not even sure my sisters will be available .	Marge Simpson
i 'll take that bet .	Homer Simpson
well if you have other plans ...	Marge Simpson
poor brandy . aunt selma , do you think you 'll ever get married ?	Lisa Simpson
no . and , since i 'm sure that you 'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece , i 'll simply hope that you 're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair prince .	Lisa Simpson
patty ! selma ! we 're home .	Marge Simpson
i 'll tell you one thing , greasy joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me .	Homer Simpson
oh and that sauce , barney . i could have drunk a bowl of it by itself ! no barney , that 's just my sister-in-law .	Homer Simpson
well ... i 'll try .	Marge Simpson
homer ? do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the bowler 's hall of fame in st. louis , missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin ?	Marge Simpson
remember ? who could forget ?	Homer Simpson
then you 'll also remember that you owe me a favor ...	Marge Simpson
... to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire .	Marge Simpson
but that was just an idle promise .	Homer Simpson
not to me .	Marge Simpson
i want you to find a husband for my sister selma .	Marge Simpson
find a husband ? which one 's selma again ?	Homer Simpson
she 's the one who likes police academy movies and hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days .	Marge Simpson
oh yeah , yeah , yeah . but i thought she did n't like to be ... you know , touched .	Homer Simpson
it 's patty who chose the life of celibacy . selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her .	Marge Simpson
but marge ...	Homer Simpson
homer , you will find her a man .	Marge Simpson
all right .	Homer Simpson
and not just any man .	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
he should be honest ... and caring ... and well off ... and handsome ...	Marge Simpson
hey ! why should she have a better husband than you do ?	Homer Simpson
what 's this stuff for ?	Bart Simpson
what 's a herbicide ?	Bart Simpson
excellent .	Bart Simpson

miss winthrop , i was thinking ...	Bart Simpson
on the left is mr. largo , my music teacher at school . he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul . and on the right is bleeding gums murphy . he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth , so you better stick an instrument in front of it .	Lisa Simpson
hm .	Marge Simpson
and look !	Lisa Simpson
come on , homer . i want you to see what your sick little girl did .	Marge Simpson

bart !	Homer Simpson
i 've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog . but when i look into his vacant brown eyes , i just ca n't bear to let him go . i 'm sure mom agrees with me .	Lisa Simpson
no , i 'm afraid i agree with your father .	Marge Simpson
you do ? ha ha , ha ha ha !	Homer Simpson
homer , please . it 's not just the quilt . he 's a nice dog , but he chews up everything . he does n't obey . he 's not even housebroken . and we 've spent all this money on an obedience school and i do n't see any improvement .	Marge Simpson
all right , all right . if santa 's little helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog , can we keep him then ?	Bart Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
dad !	Bart Simpson
... since you get paid either way , would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass ?	Bart Simpson
dad , this is our pet . we can question his integrity and disposition , but we ca n't question his heart . are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away ?	Lisa Simpson
oh lisa , if they 're ever going to pull the plug on me , i want you in my corner , honey .	Homer Simpson
oh , all right . if he passes obedience school , we can keep him .	Marge Simpson
yea !	Lisa Simpson
