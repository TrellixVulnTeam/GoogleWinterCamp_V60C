milhouse , good to see you , pal . what 's happening , man ?	Bart Simpson

i love you , but i must kill you .	Homer Simpson
yeah , take care , man . hey , thanks for coming . hey , nice tie , nelson..	Bart Simpson
lisa , i have this strong unpleasant feeling i 've never had before .	Bart Simpson

you grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before .	Lisa Simpson
i am the champions / i am the champions / no time for losers / cause i am the champions / of the worlllld !	Homer Simpson
uh , oh .	Homer Simpson
hi , honey . uh , oh . how 's the marriage retreat going ?	Homer Simpson

we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble , but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble . homer , how can you expect me to believe ... .	Marge Simpson
marge , you do n't know what this fish means . this fish represents a better life for both of us . this fish makes me a champion and a hero .	Homer Simpson
to who ?	Marge Simpson
to those weirdos in the worm store .	Homer Simpson
all this fish represents is just how selfish you are .	Marge Simpson
well , if that 's the way you feel ... i 'll throw it back .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , sure .	Marge Simpson
watch .	Homer Simpson
wow , i did it ! i gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage . i fought it for six hours . she says one word and i toss it back . and you 're telling me our marriage is in trouble ? come here , baby .	Homer Simpson

i 'll never trust another old person .	Bart Simpson
hurry , mom ! if we do n't get to the convention soon , all the good comics will be gone .	Lisa Simpson
wow ! number nine ! that 's before fallout boy became his ward .	Bart Simpson
what do you care about good comics ? all you ever buy is casper the wimpy ghost .	Bart Simpson
i think it 's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness , and i hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity .	Lisa Simpson
well , you know what i think ? i think casper 's the ghost of richie rich .	Bart Simpson
hey , they do look alike !	Lisa Simpson
i wonder how richie died ?	Bart Simpson
perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is , and took his own life .	Lisa Simpson
kids , could you lighten up a little ?	Marge Simpson
now , radioactive man : he rules ! never punches a bad guy without saying something cool .	Bart Simpson
he 's no wittier than the next superhero .	Lisa Simpson
oh , yeah ? look . he knocks a guy into the sun and says , `` hot enough for ya ? ''	Bart Simpson
i stand corrected .	Lisa Simpson
we 're here !	Marge Simpson
too bad we did n't come dressed as popular cartoon characters .	Lisa Simpson

for months , i worked and worked , while my sisters smoked and smoked ...	Marge Simpson
but the big day finally came . and because i 'd worked for it , all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good .	Marge Simpson
so maybe a part-time job is the answer .	Marge Simpson
aw , mom , i could n't ask you to do that . you 're already taking care of maggie , and lisa is such a handful --	Bart Simpson
she means you should get a job , stupid .	Lisa Simpson

sweet dreams , boys .	Bart Simpson

aw , mom .	Bart Simpson
now come on ... you can play your little tie-up game inside . i 've got some cocoa on the stove . who wants imitation marshmallows ?	Marge Simpson
we worked so hard and now it 's all gone ... we ended up with nothing because the three of us ca n't share .	Bart Simpson
nothing . it just kind of ticks me off .	Bart Simpson
joke 's on them . if the core explodes , there wo n't be any power to light that sign .	Homer Simpson
how many hairs on my head ? without looking !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you guys . there 's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help . and you do n't wan na cash in ? that 's why you losers are stuck in this crummy , dead end job .	Homer Simpson

bart , you have to help someone in need . it 's the only decent thing to do .	Marge Simpson
bart , it 's not like i 'm asking you to give blood for free . that would be crazy ! you 're a little young to understand this , but when you save a rich man 's life , he showers you with riches . do n't you know the story of hercules and the lion ?	Homer Simpson
is it a bible story ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , probably . anyway , once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw . and all the village people tried to pull it out , but nobody was strong enough . so they got hercules , and hercules used his mighty strength , and bingo . anyway , the moral is , the lion was so happy , he gave hercules this big thing of riches .	Homer Simpson
how did a lion get rich ?	Bart Simpson
it was the olden days !	Homer Simpson
oh .	Bart Simpson
hey , let 's go ! emergency ! life-or-death here !	Homer Simpson

`` better half , '' marge . `` better half . ''	Homer Simpson
all right , there 's no check , just a card . but do n't panic . i 'm sure it tells us what we 're getting and where we can pick it up . `` dear bart ... thank you kindly for the blood . yours truly , montgomery burns . '' it 's just a card !	Homer Simpson
this is some way to show your gratitude . no gold . no diamonds . no rubies . not even a lousy card . wait a minute , there was a card . that 's what got me so mad in the first place .	Homer Simpson
homer , you do n't do things like that to be rewarded . you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand .	Marge Simpson
marge , you 're my wife and i love you very much . but you 're living in a world of make-believe . with flowers and bells and leprechauns , and magic frogs with funny little hats ...	Homer Simpson
yeah , mom . we got hosed !	Bart Simpson
bart !	Homer Simpson
we got exactly what we wanted out of this : we gave an old man a second chance .	Marge Simpson

... as i was shoving it into the mailbox .	Bart Simpson
why did you do that ?	Homer Simpson
dad , there were things in the letter that had to be said . and i know you . you 're an emotional guy . just because you were mad last night , is no guarantee you 'd be mad in the morning . so i ...	Bart Simpson
i 'll show you mad in the morning .	Homer Simpson
homer , you encouraged him . you should be strangling yourself .	Marge Simpson
she 's right . okay , think , homer . do n't panic . they do n't pick up the mail till noon . there 's still time !	Homer Simpson
ow . ow . ow . ow . ow . ow . ow .	Homer Simpson
give it up , homer . it 's locked up tight .	Bart Simpson
locked , eh ? well , i just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old mr. lock . step aside , boy .	Homer Simpson
why the hose , homer ?	Bart Simpson
what does it look like ? i 'll get our letter so wet , the ink will run and no one will be able to read it .	Homer Simpson
yeah , but do n't other people have mail in there ?	Bart Simpson
so a few people wo n't get a few letters . boo-hoo . you know the kinda letters people write : `` dear somebody-you-never-heard-of ... how is so-and-so ? blah blah blah blah blah blah blah . yours truly , some bozo . '' big loss .	Homer Simpson
now bart , you keep an eye out for the mailman . just give me some kind of signal .	Homer Simpson
dad , the mailman is here .	Bart Simpson
that 's a good one . we 'll use that .	Homer Simpson
no , i mean the mailman 's here .	Bart Simpson

well , i 'm still gon na run !	Homer Simpson
i do n't know .	Homer Simpson
great plan , bart .	Homer Simpson
ooh , look , maggie , what is that ? do-dec-ah-edron . dodecahedron .	Lisa Simpson

honey , what 's done is done . no matter what happens , we 'll pull through . we always do .	Marge Simpson
okay , here 's the plan . you can move in with your sisters and raise the kids . and i 'll ... die in a gutter . it 's practical and within our means .	Homer Simpson
that 's okay , bart . nobody really believed it . we were just trying to scare you .	Lisa Simpson
eh , yeah , hello , is mike there ? last name , rotch .	Bart Simpson
i got my problems , moe . give me another one .	Homer Simpson
oh , woe is me .	Homer Simpson

save a guy 's life , and whattaya get ? nothin ' ! worse than nothin ' ! just a big , scary rock .	Homer Simpson
hey , man , do n't bad-mouth the head .	Bart Simpson
homer , it 's the thought that counts . the moral of this story is , `` a good deed is its own reward . ''	Marge Simpson
hey , we got a reward . the head is cool !	Bart Simpson
well then , i guess the moral is , `` no good deed goes unrewarded . ''	Marge Simpson
wait a minute . if i had n't written that nasty letter , we would n't have gotten anything !	Homer Simpson
well ... then i guess the moral is , `` the squeaky wheel gets the grease . ''	Marge Simpson
perhaps there is no moral to this story .	Lisa Simpson
exactly . it 's just a bunch of stuff that happened .	Homer Simpson
but it certainly was a memorable few days !	Marge Simpson
amen to that !	Homer Simpson

when america was born on that hot july day in 1776 , the trees in springfield forest were tiny saplings , trembling towards the sun . and as they were nourished by mother earth , so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice . who would have thought such mighty oaks , or such a powerful nation , could grow out of something so fragile ... so pure . thank you .	Lisa Simpson

that 's ridiculous .	Marge Simpson
marge , i 've got to get her a pony . when i look in lisa 's eyes , i do n't see love anymore .	Homer Simpson

actually , i was thinking we could cut down on your beer .	Marge Simpson
nah , we 're not gon na be doing that .	Homer Simpson
then i 'm afraid there 's no choice but to give up the pony back .	Marge Simpson

homer ...	Marge Simpson
marge , lisa loves me , the pony stays .	Homer Simpson

bart !	Lisa Simpson
i was trying to gnaw my foot off , but i could n't get through my sock . goodnight everybody .	Bart Simpson

the police will catch you sooner or later .	Lisa Simpson

help ! help ! i fell down the well .	Bart Simpson

hey , stop that !	Lisa Simpson
bart ? honey , i made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you 're down in the well .	Marge Simpson
mom , it 's too big .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , you 'll grow into it .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
you know , i 've done a lot of bad stuff through the years . i guess now i 'm paying the price . but there 's so many things i 'll never get a chance to do . smoke a cigarette , use a fake i.d. , shave a swear word in my hair ...	Bart Simpson

daaaaad ! you 're not listening to me .	Lisa Simpson
lousy , stupid denver .	Homer Simpson
oh , look at that , a shoe box house . lisa , you 're so clever .	Marge Simpson
why is n't dad ever interested in anything i do ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... do you ever take an interest in anything he does ?	Marge Simpson
no ... . well , we used to have burping contests , but i outgrew it .	Lisa Simpson
hmmm , well , if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap . i do it all the time . i pretend i 'm interested in looking at power tools , going to those silly car chase movies , and ... some things i 'll tell you about when you 're older . do you understand ?	Marge Simpson
i think so .	Lisa Simpson
bart !	Marge Simpson
whaaat ?	Bart Simpson
why did you do that ?	Homer Simpson
would n't it be fun if we watched the game together ?	Lisa Simpson
okay , just do n't say anything and sit down over there .	Homer Simpson
over .	Homer Simpson
over ... over ... over ...	Homer Simpson
lisa , please , i ca n't hear the announcer .	Homer Simpson
he said denver just fumbled .	Lisa Simpson
see you in hell , soldier boy !	Bart Simpson
bart ?	Marge Simpson
yeah mom ?	Bart Simpson
i was thinking that while your father and lisa watch the game , it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping .	Marge Simpson
mom , i 'd love to . but to be honest , i do n't need new clothes .	Bart Simpson
oh really ?	Marge Simpson
hmm ...	Marge Simpson
so even though i 'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes . it 's not ...	Bart Simpson
why did n't you say that before !	Homer Simpson
oooh , that 's a big lock all right . i just do n't trust that guy .	Homer Simpson
huh , they both make a good case .	Homer Simpson
yeah !	Homer Simpson
line ...	Homer Simpson
yeah , lay it on me , coach .	Homer Simpson
mm-hm .	Homer Simpson
cincinnati ...	Homer Simpson
cincinnati .	Homer Simpson
cincinnati .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , c'mon ! do n't you realize this is costing me money ?	Homer Simpson
doh , not the wind .	Homer Simpson
oh ...	Homer Simpson
... miles per hour .	Homer Simpson
ugh , this is ridiculous . what am i supposed to do ? lisa , who do you think 's gon na win ? the bengals or the dolphins ?	Homer Simpson
good , good . moe , fifty dollars on the miami dolphins .	Homer Simpson
mom , i 'm tired . i wan na go home . ca n't i just lie down for a minute ?	Bart Simpson
now bart , i think you 'd look very sharp in this shirt .	Marge Simpson
fine , get it . lets go .	Bart Simpson
no , no , no , you have to try it on .	Marge Simpson
oooh , and this one 's fifty percent off .	Marge Simpson
you know why these clothes are on sale , mom ? because the people who wear them get beaten up .	Bart Simpson
well , anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt is n't your friend . ooh this looks good ... . oh and this one is very , very cute ... and these ... oh look ! little bow ties .	Marge Simpson
and do n't make that face at me .	Marge Simpson
how 'd ya know ?	Bart Simpson
all right , dolphins !	Homer Simpson
all right , dolphins !	Lisa Simpson
whoo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
whoo-hoo !	Lisa Simpson
fifty big ones !	Homer Simpson
fifty big ones ?	Lisa Simpson
uh-oh . you see , lisa , daddy 's friend moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the dolphins won the game .	Homer Simpson
you mean you made a bet ?	Lisa Simpson
well , i would n't call it a bet . it 's a little thing daddies do to make football more exciting .	Homer Simpson
what could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... you know ... you like ice cream , do n't you ?	Homer Simpson
uh-huh .	Lisa Simpson
see how good things can happen if you make a little effort ?	Marge Simpson
and do n't you like ice cream better when it 's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up ... hmmm . crumbled up cookie things ...	Homer Simpson
so gambling makes a good thing even better .	Lisa Simpson
that 's right . my god , it 's like there 's some kind of bond between us .	Homer Simpson
bart ?	Marge Simpson
in here , mom . but do n't open the --	Bart Simpson
oh bart , you could use some new underwear too .	Marge Simpson
... three , two , one ...	Lisa Simpson
yeah !	Homer Simpson
boy , mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars .	Lisa Simpson
you 'd think that would n't you . but you see lisa , your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong . even though they say it 's okay in the bible .	Homer Simpson
really , where ?	Lisa Simpson
uh ... somewhere in the back . the point is we had a great time today . and to keep it that way , let 's not tell your mother about our little wager . okay ?	Homer Simpson
okay , dad .	Lisa Simpson
did you two have fun ?	Marge Simpson
you bet .	Homer Simpson
well , we had fun too . right now , bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends .	Marge Simpson
goodnight , dad . i had a really nice time today .	Lisa Simpson
me too , honey .	Homer Simpson
can i watch football with you again next sunday ?	Lisa Simpson
sure ! you 'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church .	Homer Simpson
point well taken . uh , mom , could you loosen my blanket a little ? dad tucked me in too tight and it 's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs .	Lisa Simpson
all right !	Homer Simpson
he 'll lose .	Lisa Simpson
what ? did n't you hear what he said ?	Homer Simpson
look at the fear in his eyes . listen to the quiver in his voice . he 's a little boy , lost in a game of men .	Lisa Simpson
you think we should bet against them ?	Homer Simpson
i 'd bet my entire college fund on it .	Lisa Simpson
you got it .	Homer Simpson
moe , twenty-three dollars on new york .	Homer Simpson
dad , i hate to break the mood , but i 'm getting nauseous .	Lisa Simpson
oh , sorry . so who do you like in the afternoon games ?	Homer Simpson
well , i like the 49ers because they 're pure of heart -- seattle because they got something to prove -- and the raiders because they always cheat .	Lisa Simpson
hey , the new sign is really working .	Lisa Simpson
let 's see ... football ... football : homo-eroticism in ... oddball canadian rules ... phyllis george and ...	Lisa Simpson
my daughter , that 's who !	Homer Simpson
yeah , me !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , you 've picked the winner every time ! you must have some kind of special gift .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , dad . it does n't take a genius to realize that houston 's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf , the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game .	Lisa Simpson
oh , my little girl says the cutest things .	Homer Simpson
you know , dad , sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week .	Lisa Simpson
not sunday -- daddy-daughter day .	Homer Simpson
the usual , moe . a beer and a wad of bills .	Homer Simpson
i used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet . now it 's the smell of victory .	Homer Simpson
look at these prices . we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal .	Marge Simpson
tut-tut . only the best for my family .	Homer Simpson
homer , i ca n't help wondering where you 're getting the money from ?	Marge Simpson
mom , ca n't a man do something nice for his loved ones ?	Lisa Simpson
hmm , i guess so .	Marge Simpson
hello , i 'm homer . i 'll be your customer .	Homer Simpson
i 'll do the honors .	Bart Simpson
no . no . no . no . my god , what passes for a wine list these days . marco , just bring us your freshest bottle of wine . chop . chop .	Bart Simpson
oh , violin guy !	Homer Simpson
what 's your favorite song , lisa ?	Homer Simpson
the broken neck blues .	Lisa Simpson
play on .	Homer Simpson
well , lisa , it 's daddy-daughter day and daddy needs daughter 's picks .	Homer Simpson
you promised you would n't get mad !	Homer Simpson
dad , i 'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special . and with your blessing , i 'd like to tie it to the cowboys plus five at chicago .	Lisa Simpson
good , good ... you call moe .	Homer Simpson
moe , this is l.s . calling for h.s .	Lisa Simpson
barney , are you nuts ? that 's the super bowl . how about the sunday after that ?	Homer Simpson
the happiest day of my life was three sundays ago . i was sitting on my daddy 's knee when the saints , who were four and a half point favorites , but only up by three , kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second , to cover the spread .	Lisa Simpson
oh dad , you must 've bought me every malibu stacey accessory there is .	Lisa Simpson
not quite . they were out of the malibu stacie lunar rovers .	Homer Simpson
ooh , perfume . meryl streep 's `` versatility . ''	Marge Simpson
boy , i know you 're gon na like your present .	Homer Simpson
dad , i promise you i will never get tired of this .	Bart Simpson
homer , those are very thoughtful presents . but you have to tell me where you got the money from .	Marge Simpson
all right , marge . i 'll tell you , but first you have to promise you will not get mad .	Homer Simpson
i promise i will get mad , because i always do when you make me promise i wo n't .	Marge Simpson
all right . if you must know , lisa and i have been gambling on pro football .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
i did not ! i promised i would get mad ! she 's an eight-year-old girl .	Marge Simpson
but marge , she never loses . she 's got a gift . are n't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent ?	Homer Simpson
but gambling is illegal .	Marge Simpson
only in forty-eight states . besides , it 's a victimless crime . the only victim is moe , heh , heh , heh . and it 's brought lisa and me together .	Homer Simpson
well , i just do n't know .	Marge Simpson
look , what 's the problem ? the kids are happy , you smell like meryl streep , and i 've got that foot massager i 've always wanted .	Homer Simpson
believe me , marge , nothing bad could possibly come of this .	Homer Simpson
you know , dad , we 've been watching a lot of tv lately . maybe , the sunday after the super bowl , we could hike up to the top of mount springfield . the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets .	Lisa Simpson
well , that sounds great honey , but next sunday i 'm going bowling with barney .	Homer Simpson
what about daddy-daughter day ?	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry , the new football season is only seven months away .	Homer Simpson
so that 's it . you just wanted me to help you gamble . you never wanted to be with me at all .	Lisa Simpson
you 're a very selfish man .	Marge Simpson
hey , once again . great present , dad .	Bart Simpson
my third husband bought me this .	Lisa Simpson
give me some chips for it .	Lisa Simpson
do n't tell me what to do , sonny . i 've been gambling since i was eight . and i 've been hockin ' jewelry since i was twelve . now give me some chips !	Lisa Simpson
look around you , malibu stacey . all this was bought with dirty money . your penthouse , your alfa romeo , your collagen injection clinic .	Lisa Simpson
you 're going back into the shoe-box . it may not be pretty , but dammit , it 's honest .	Lisa Simpson
i , lisa simpson , am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten malibu stacey accessories !	Lisa Simpson
look lisa , i bought you a malibu stacey chinchilla coat .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
so you 've come to buy my forgiveness . sorry , homer .	Lisa Simpson
look lisa , honey , i 'm sorry i hurt your feelings . but i really had a good time watching football with you . and i think you had a good time with me .	Homer Simpson
yeah , i did .	Lisa Simpson
well , c'mon , we can still watch the super bowl together . ca n't we ? eh ? huh ?	Homer Simpson
well , i would like to see what all the fuss is about .	Lisa Simpson
it 's a date ! so ... do you think the cowboys will beat the spread ?	Homer Simpson
put me down .	Lisa Simpson
look dad , i 'll tell you who 's gon na win the super bowl if you want me to . but it 'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me .	Lisa Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
i think dallas is a mortal lock .	Lisa Simpson
dallas ! whoo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
however ...	Lisa Simpson
however ? what however ? what do you mean , however ? however what ?	Homer Simpson
however , i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose . in which case , i 'd bet the farm on buffalo .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , do me a favor . complete this sentence : `` daddy should bet all his money on ... ''	Homer Simpson
i do n't know .	Lisa Simpson
if i still love you , dallas . if i do n't , buffalo .	Lisa Simpson
homer , i think that chip 's got enough dip on it .	Marge Simpson
oh , this sucks . c'mon snipers . where are you ?	Bart Simpson
oh , every note is like a dagger in my heart . i got ta get outta here .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , moe . i 'm not bettin ' .	Homer Simpson
i had the greatest gift of all , a little girl who could pick football and i ruined it .	Homer Simpson
buffalo 's gon na win . lisa hates me !	Homer Simpson
my daughter .	Homer Simpson
bart , who 's winning ?	Lisa Simpson
you hate dad is up by a touchdown .	Bart Simpson
not duff dry ... dallas .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
all right , we 're back in business .	Homer Simpson
please , please , please ...	Homer Simpson
i guess you love dad .	Bart Simpson
i suspected as much .	Lisa Simpson
yes ! she loves me ! she loves me !	Homer Simpson
money comes and money goes , but what i have with my daughter can go on for eight more years !	Homer Simpson
come on , dad !	Lisa Simpson
it 's beautiful .	Homer Simpson
is n't it though ?	Lisa Simpson
after i catch my breath ... can we ... go ... home ?	Homer Simpson
i am not cleaning that ... ah , who am i kidding ?	Marge Simpson
now maggie , when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want .	Marge Simpson
extra mustard for bart , sliced diagonally not lengthwise ... light mayo for lisa , cut off the crust ... double bologna for homer ... .	Marge Simpson
marge , i split my pants again . oooh , can i have two sandwiches today ? make them bologna sandwiches too . can i have two slices of bologna and cheese ...	Homer Simpson
one at a time ! one at a time !	Marge Simpson
do n't even bother with the raisins . i 'm not gon na eat 'em ... double bologna ! double bologna ! ... i do n't ask for much , just no pimento . do n't forget to make it double bologna 'cause i can hardly ...	Lisa Simpson
that 's enough !	Marge Simpson
there you go , lisa . no pimentos . bart , your hat 's where you left it , behind the toilet . homer , i 'll sew your pants but i 'm out of bologna .	Marge Simpson
thanks mom .	Bart Simpson
thanks mom .	Lisa Simpson
videos to return , grocery list , flea dip for the cat , homer 's dry-cleaning -- i think that 's everything .	Marge Simpson
marge , can you take my ball to nick 's today ? a bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole .	Homer Simpson
homer , i 'm running late as it is . ca n't you just use one of the balls at the alley ?	Marge Simpson
alley balls ?	Homer Simpson
alright , do n't whine . just put it in my left hand .	Marge Simpson
kids ! hurry up or you 're going to miss your bus !	Marge Simpson
no way .	Lisa Simpson

boy , you 've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth .	Homer Simpson
no , homer . the truth would humiliate her .	Marge Simpson
oh , marge . i only said it because i thought that 's what you wanted to hear .	Homer Simpson
maybe we should write her another letter . one that says good-bye but lets her feel loved .	Lisa Simpson
step aside everyone . sensitive love letters are my specialty .	Homer Simpson
`` dear baby , welcome to dumpville . population : you . ''	Homer Simpson
we 'll all help .	Marge Simpson
`` though i 'll be inoculating babies in kampuchea , my heart will always be with you . ''	Lisa Simpson
that sucks . how 'bout , `` crocodiles bit off my face . ''	Bart Simpson
that 's disgusting . and besides , when a woman loves a man , it does n't matter that a crocodile bit off his face .	Marge Simpson
i may hold you to that , marge .	Homer Simpson
`` okay , okay ... i can not see you for the next five years , for i will be farming the ocean floor . ''	Lisa Simpson
`` i must finish this letter quickly , for i have only four minutes to live . ''	Bart Simpson
three simple words . i am gay .	Homer Simpson

sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal , i ran for cover under the tallest tree i could find .	Homer Simpson
something told me this was a very special , very magical , piece of wood that i could make a bat out of .	Homer Simpson
i put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world 's greatest bat .	Homer Simpson

marge , forget it . he 's bigger than me , faster than me , stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than i do .	Homer Simpson
you make me sick homer . you 're the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it .	Bart Simpson

well , i 'm gon na be a famous jazz musician . i 've got it all figured out . i 'll be unappreciated in my own country , but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the french . i 'll avoid the horrors of drug abuse , but i do plan to have several torrid love affairs . and i may or may not die young , i have n't decided .	Lisa Simpson

i guess so .	Homer Simpson
she 's wonderful . i could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit .	Lisa Simpson

shut up , boy . marge , what do you think ?	Homer Simpson
well , it 's nice . but who is this woman ?	Marge Simpson

mrs. homer simpson .	Marge Simpson

that 's them . now remember everyone , be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity .	Marge Simpson
sideshow bob !	Lisa Simpson
that 's right , aunt selma . your new boyfriend here framed krusty the clown for armed robbery .	Bart Simpson
gee , if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison , the first thing out , i 'd find out where he lives , and tear him a new bellybutton .	Homer Simpson
lousy snitch .	Homer Simpson
i am not .	Homer Simpson
do n't be a fool , aunt selma . that man is scum .	Bart Simpson
aye-carumba !	Bart Simpson
knock it off .	Bart Simpson

selma , i 've never seen you so happy . giggling like a schoolgirl .	Marge Simpson
i ca n't believe you guys . this man framed krusty the clown .	Bart Simpson
bart !	Marge Simpson
hear hear ! .	Homer Simpson
that sideshow bob is a no-good showbiz phony .	Bart Simpson
come on , bart . if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him , surely you can too .	Lisa Simpson
now , about your wedding dress . i 'm not sure how to put this ...	Marge Simpson
white . and what would you like for appetizers ?	Marge Simpson
oooh , appetizers .	Homer Simpson
well , you ca n't go wrong with cocktail weenies . they taste as good as they look . and they come in this delicious red sauce . it looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup . but brother it ai n't ketchup !	Homer Simpson
okay , we 've got cocktail wienies and swedish meatballs .	Marge Simpson
ah , that 's sweet .	Marge Simpson
there , there ...	Marge Simpson
oh well , i guess the wedding 's off . fiddle dee dee , tomorrow 's another day .	Bart Simpson
bart ! stop that .	Marge Simpson
oh , would you two knock it off ? i hate all the programs marge likes . but it 's no big deal . you know why ?	Homer Simpson
whenever marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs , i take a walk . i go to a bar , i down a few , and i stumble home in the mood for love .	Homer Simpson
bart no like . bad medicine .	Bart Simpson
i could 've been the flower girl . and i would n't keep falling down either .	Lisa Simpson

go ahead , patty .	Marge Simpson
aunt selma has one hour to live !	Bart Simpson
hey , down in front .	Homer Simpson
sideshow bob , i 'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at best western hotels .	Bart Simpson
chief wiggum , think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser ?	Bart Simpson
well , i 'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job .	Bart Simpson
all right . sideshow bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace . but why ? then it hit me -- the gas .	Bart Simpson
surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except aunt selma .	Bart Simpson
she happily watched her macgyver , unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas . all it needed to explode was a single spark ... say , from a cigarette ...	Bart Simpson
her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father .	Bart Simpson
dad , when aunt selma lights up her cigarette at the end of macgyver , she 'll be blown to kingdom come !	Bart Simpson
come again ?	Homer Simpson
after trying four times to explain it to homer , i explained it to mom and we were on our way .	Bart Simpson

dad , otto 's going through a real tough time . ca n't he stay with us for awhile ?	Bart Simpson
i know we did n't ask for this , homer , but does n't the bible say , `` whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers , that you do unto me ... ? ''	Marge Simpson
yes , but does n't the bible also say , `` thou shalt not take moochers into thy ... hut '' ?	Homer Simpson
please , dad . if you let otto stay , he 'll help around the house , and chip in a few bucks whenever he can .	Bart Simpson
all right . he can stay . but i get to treat him like garbage .	Homer Simpson

i 'll tell you the truth , dad . i was n't good at it right away , so i quit . i hope you 're not mad .	Bart Simpson
you can do it , otto . you 're the coolest adult i ever met .	Bart Simpson
son , come here . heh , heh , heh . of course i 'm not mad . if something 's hard to do , then it 's not worth doing . you just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio , your karate outfit , and your unicycle and we 'll go inside and watch tv .	Homer Simpson
what 's on ?	Bart Simpson
it does n't matter .	Homer Simpson
open up ! open up ! i got ta go and no fooling .	Homer Simpson

but she does n't melt .	Bart Simpson
chocolate ...	Homer Simpson
ooh , sweet .	Homer Simpson
dad , what if i told you , you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'd say `` you 're a lying scumbag . '' why sweetie ?	Homer Simpson
according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning . that 's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it .	Lisa Simpson
oh lisa , that 's a load of rich , creamery butter .	Homer Simpson
they 'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep . as you hear new-age music , a powerful message goes to your brain , telling you to eat less .	Lisa Simpson
lose weight and listen to new-age music ? wow ! what do you think , marge ?	Homer Simpson
oh , homer , i love you just the way you are . lisa , what 's that number ?	Marge Simpson
operator , i 'd like to place an order for my husband .	Marge Simpson
hmmm ... hostage negotiations .	Marge Simpson
listen , tabouli , we 're ignoring all of your demands . what do you say to that ?	Homer Simpson
better give me the weight loss tape .	Marge Simpson
homer , has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite ?	Marge Simpson
lamentably , no . my gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety .	Homer Simpson
do n't you usually play with milhouse after school ?	Marge Simpson
he has a girlfriend .	Bart Simpson
milhouse ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , all they do is kiss .	Bart Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
how cute .	Marge Simpson
hey martin .	Bart Simpson
listen martin , right now i 'm looking for a friend who wo n't leave me for a girl .	Bart Simpson
yeah , right . anyway ... do you want to do something after school ?	Bart Simpson
uh , sure .	Bart Simpson
i do n't know if that tape is working . you ate three desserts tonight .	Marge Simpson
forbearance is the watchword . that triumvirate of twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve .	Homer Simpson
there 's another thing i 've been wanting to talk to you about ...	Marge Simpson
tut tut , gentle marge . for here in the boudoir , the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary !	Homer Simpson
what in god 's name are you talking about ?	Marge Simpson
oh .	Marge Simpson
hey , guys .	Bart Simpson
hey , i 've got an idea . why do n't the three of us go spit on the principal 's car ?	Bart Simpson
oh . fine . i 'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle . there 's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town .	Bart Simpson
yeah ?	Bart Simpson
what ? get bent .	Bart Simpson
all right , milhouse . you can use my tree house .	Bart Simpson
samantha and milhouse sitting in a tree , about to lose their pri-va-cy !	Bart Simpson
now there 's a machiavellian countenance .	Homer Simpson
ooh ... a sextet of ale .	Homer Simpson
hello , mr. stanky ... i have some shocking news about your daughter samantha ... who am i ? let 's just say i 'm a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands .	Bart Simpson
well milhouse , `` 't is better to have loved and lost '' ... yada yada yada ... let 's go to the arcade .	Bart Simpson
nah .	Homer Simpson
dad ! dad ! do you know what today is ?	Lisa Simpson
the vernal equinox ?	Homer Simpson
no . it 's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape . let 's get you on the scale .	Lisa Simpson
you 've gained thirteen pounds .	Lisa Simpson
disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery ! a pox on them !	Homer Simpson
hey bart , according to this magazine , in another million years , man will have an extra finger .	Lisa Simpson
five fingers ? ew , freak show . listen , lis . i need some advice and mom 's not here .	Bart Simpson
why did n't you go to dad ?	Lisa Simpson
i did , but i could n't understand what the hell he was saying . lisa , i feel terrible . i ratted on my best friend and he does n't even know i did it .	Bart Simpson
well , according to `` eternity '' magazine , the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine . dow chemical is developing a minty gel , which will eliminate excess guilt , but unfortunately it wo n't be on the market for another six months . so i guess you 're gon na have to bite the bullet and confess to milhouse .	Lisa Simpson
yeah .	Bart Simpson
milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
oh , come on , i 've seen you cry a million times . you cry when you scrape your knee . you cry when they 're out of chocolate milk . you cry when you 're doing long division and you have a remainder left over .	Bart Simpson
listen , milhouse . i 've got a confession to make . i 'm the one who narked on your kissing .	Bart Simpson
boy , i bet the 8-ball did n't see that one comin ' .	Bart Simpson
marge , where 's that ... metal dealie ... you use to ... dig ... food .	Homer Simpson
you mean a spoon ?	Marge Simpson
yuh . yuh . yuh .	Homer Simpson
yeah that 's good .	Homer Simpson
are you sure you want to do this ?	Bart Simpson
how are we going to find her ?	Bart Simpson
hey samantha , i 'm sorry about gettin ' you thrown in the penguin house .	Bart Simpson
you 're asking the wrong guy , milhouse . they all look alike to me . now let 's go whip donuts at old people	Bart Simpson
forgot there was a physical today , huh ?	Homer Simpson
go to hell .	Homer Simpson
how was your day at work , dear ?	Marge Simpson
oh , the usual . stand in front of this , open that , pull down this , bend over , spread apart that , turn your head that way , cough ...	Homer Simpson
herb ?	Homer Simpson
and now , the next event ... in our living room olympics ... the always controversial , couch vault . i do this for stain master carpets . proud sponsor of the living room olympics .	Bart Simpson
what the hell are you two ...	Homer Simpson
oh , my couch ! the arms , the seat ... the dream is over . all right , who did this ?	Homer Simpson
we were just sitting on the couch , quietly chatting , when we heard a creaking noise .	Bart Simpson
we leapt off just in time to see it collapse .	Lisa Simpson
there , there . you 're safe now , little sister .	Bart Simpson
well , why did this have to happen now , during primetime , when tv 's brightest stars come out to shine ! ?	Homer Simpson
oh , goodbye , old girl . we 've had a lot of great memories .	Homer Simpson
hands across america ...	Marge Simpson
boring .	Homer Simpson
well friend , you 're going back where you came from . the curb in front of flanders ' house .	Homer Simpson
yeah . you know , my life just ca n't get any worse .	Homer Simpson
that 's right . there 's no way my life could possibly get any worse .	Homer Simpson
would i !	Homer Simpson
wait a minute . i 'm not signing anything until i read it , or somebody gives me the gist of it .	Homer Simpson
do n't i get some kind of trophy ? at a big award ceremony ?	Homer Simpson
herb !	Homer Simpson
this award is the biggest farce i ever saw .	Lisa Simpson
what about the emmys ?	Bart Simpson
i stand corrected .	Lisa Simpson
please please please please please ...	Homer Simpson
dad , you know you won .	Lisa Simpson
do n't jinx it !	Homer Simpson
oh , my god ! ! woo hoo ! i win !	Homer Simpson
i miss my couch .	Homer Simpson
pfft ! heavyweight championship . there 's like three of those . that couch was one of a kind .	Homer Simpson
i think i 'm gon na take a walk .	Homer Simpson
i feel so empty . so alone , so ... couchless .	Homer Simpson
wow . the spine melter 2000 .	Homer Simpson
give me full power .	Homer Simpson
dammit , i said full power !	Homer Simpson
dad ? dad ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'll take it .	Homer Simpson
this chair is $ 2,000 . we could buy a whole living room set for that .	Marge Simpson
marge , there 's an empty spot i 've always had inside me . i tried to fill it with family , religion , community service . but those were dead ends . i think this chair is the answer .	Homer Simpson
this money was a blessing . we ca n't just spend it on some creature comfort .	Marge Simpson
all right , we wo n't get the chair . now excuse me while i kiss the sky .	Homer Simpson
they 're singing again . lousy neighbors . wish i was deaf .	Homer Simpson
unky herb !	Lisa Simpson
you were n't so glad to see me .	Homer Simpson
well , while you 're a guest in my home , could you just kick me in the butt ?	Homer Simpson
herb ! how have you been ?	Marge Simpson
ca n't complain .	Marge Simpson
herb , let me give you the grand tour . this is one of our many light switches . it functions in both the on and off mode .	Homer Simpson
on ... off ... on ... off .	Homer Simpson
homer , he knows how to work a light switch .	Marge Simpson
oh , yeah . right . i do n't know what this switch does .	Homer Simpson
i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel .	Marge Simpson
they do good work .	Homer Simpson
unky herb , what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself ?	Bart Simpson
why did n't you write , unky herb ?	Lisa Simpson
i see your point .	Lisa Simpson
and while on ventnor avenue you 'll be staying at the fabulous hotel lisa . a valet will be around shortly to park your thimble . of course , there is the unpleasant matter of the bill .	Lisa Simpson
eleven hundred and fifty bones .	Lisa Simpson
broke again , eh herb ? just like in real life . i guess you 're just not much of a businessman .	Homer Simpson
maybe we should play another game .	Marge Simpson
why are we playin ' games when we got two grand in the bank ! ? remember when dad won the first annual montgomery burns award for outstanding achievement in the field of excellence ?	Bart Simpson
well , i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization . look at this ad from `` new republic for kids . '' each month a new classic will be delivered to our door : `` paradise regained , '' `` martin chuzzlewit , '' or herman melville 's twin classics `` omoo '' and `` typee '' .	Lisa Simpson
wait , marge . did n't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair ?	Homer Simpson
that was your idea .	Marge Simpson
i think we should get a machine gun . we could use it to hunt game , spell out things , or ring in the new year !	Bart Simpson
well , i really think we need to replace the washer and dryer .	Marge Simpson
nah .	Homer Simpson
homer , wait . herb , what 're you talking about ?	Marge Simpson
twenty minutes ? !	Homer Simpson
it 's drinking the water !	Homer Simpson
this is the greatest invention in the world ! you 'll make a million dollars !	Homer Simpson
it 's going back for more !	Homer Simpson
maggie ! maggie !	Lisa Simpson
that 's a very clever idea !	Marge Simpson
i think we owe a debt to unky herb . he took us into his home and dad destroyed him .	Lisa Simpson
dad , you know some shyster 's gon na bilk you out of your money . it may as well be your brother .	Bart Simpson
all right , herb , i 'll lend you the two thousand bucks . but you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother .	Homer Simpson
okay , then just give me the drinking bird .	Homer Simpson
not really . we peeked inside while you were in the john .	Bart Simpson
whoooa ! !	Marge Simpson
well , it 's pretty ingrained .	Marge Simpson
herb , this is the stupidest thing i 've ever seen . i ca n't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it , when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks .	Homer Simpson
i try , but i ca n't .	Homer Simpson
maggie , you talked !	Marge Simpson
never mind .	Homer Simpson
peek-a-boo !	Lisa Simpson
i dunno , herb . people are afraid of new things . you should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something .	Homer Simpson
homer , every mother in the country is going to want one of these .	Marge Simpson
i gave herb all the money i had in the world ... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , he ca n't stay mad at you forever . he is your brother .	Marge Simpson
well , when is he gon na act like it ?	Homer Simpson
finally , a copy of `` ethan frome '' to call my own .	Lisa Simpson
wow ! the nra . can i be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets , too ?	Bart Simpson
herb , i appreciate your generosity , but i do n't need any gift from you .	Marge Simpson
herb , i do n't think there 's a vibrating chair in that bag for me .	Homer Simpson
what do i get ? what do i get ? it 's not another punch in the face is it ? because if it is , i do n't want it .	Homer Simpson
that 's it ?	Homer Simpson
i see your point , brother .	Homer Simpson
all right ... but i never really hugged a man before .	Homer Simpson
oh no , mrs. krabappel . if i do n't get a c average , my dad wo n't let me go to kamp krusty .	Bart Simpson
much obliged , doll .	Bart Simpson
la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la . la-la-la-la-la . la-la- ...	Bart Simpson
wake up , boy .	Homer Simpson
oh , i dreamt it was the last day of school .	Bart Simpson
well it is .	Homer Simpson
oh how do i know this is n't some beautiful dream , too ?	Bart Simpson
you know , a pinch is more traditional .	Bart Simpson
homie , you do remember your promise to the children ?	Marge Simpson
sure do . when you 're eighteen , you 're out the door .	Homer Simpson
no , dad . you promised if bart and i got c averages we could go to kamp krusty . and with no false modesty , you 're looking at one happy camper .	Lisa Simpson
yeah . well , just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year . it now goes : d , b , a , c .	Bart Simpson
now listen , boy . we have an understanding and you 'd better keep your end of it . i do n't think i 'd be any kind of a father if you got d 's and i let you go to kamp krusty .	Homer Simpson
but dad ...	Bart Simpson
son , if you really want something in this life you have to work for it . now quiet , they 're about to announce the lottery numbers .	Homer Simpson
woo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
36-24-36 ...	Bart Simpson
now let 's see what we got here .	Bart Simpson
ah , my gym shorts .	Bart Simpson
bart , where 's your bathing suit ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm gon na swim nekkid .	Bart Simpson
i 've never gotten a b before .	Lisa Simpson
how could this have happened ? i feel so dirty . uh.. uh ... uh . the dirt 's not coming off . okay . calm down . this must just be a little typo .	Lisa Simpson
oh miss hoover , there appears to be a mistake on my report card . you gave me a b+ in conduct .	Lisa Simpson
perhaps i 'm not making myself clear . i think you should reconsider .	Lisa Simpson
mrs. krabappel , in figuring out my final grades , i hope you 'll note that all of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition . in some cases , still in their original wrappings .	Bart Simpson
i 'd also like to add as i gaze upon your beauty , i 've never seen an angel fly so low .	Bart Simpson
mrs. krabappel , if i do n't get at least a c average i ca n't go to kamp krusty .	Bart Simpson
you 're what ?	Marge Simpson
so , bart , will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of kamp krusty ?	Lisa Simpson
you bet . check out this hand . all aces !	Bart Simpson
a+ ! oh , bart , why did n't you at least forge plausible grades ?	Lisa Simpson
well , here goes nothin ' .	Bart Simpson
stupid roller-skate .	Homer Simpson
well , dad , here 's my report card . i think you 'll be pleasantly surprised .	Bart Simpson
a+ ? you do n't think much of me , do you boy ?	Homer Simpson
no , sir .	Bart Simpson
you know a d turns into a b so easily . you just got greedy .	Homer Simpson
so i wo n't get to go to camp ?	Bart Simpson
now , bart . we made this deal because i thought it would help you get good grades . and you did n't . but why should you pay for my mistake ?	Homer Simpson
you mean i can go ?	Bart Simpson
yeah . i did n't want you hangin ' around all summer anyway .	Homer Simpson
oh , dad . you 're the best father a boy could ever have !	Bart Simpson
thanks son . now , you 've got little hands . can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate ?	Homer Simpson
ah sure , there 'll be a couple of uptight counselors who wo n't dig the bart philosophy , but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty .	Bart Simpson
marge , am i crazy , or is my back getting hairier ?	Homer Simpson
before i go to camp , i 'll need boosters for malaria , german measles , encephalitis , hansen 's disease ...	Lisa Simpson
do n't patronize me , doctor .	Lisa Simpson
it 's our last family dinner for six weeks , but i promised myself i would n't cry .	Marge Simpson
oh , i 'm going to miss this .	Marge Simpson
hey , hands off my pickle .	Bart Simpson
i do n't see your name on it , boy .	Homer Simpson
no , but ...	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ?	Homer Simpson
check ... mate .	Homer Simpson
always thinking two moves ahead .	Bart Simpson
good-bye my special little guy . lisa , watch out for poison ivy . remember , `` leaves of 3 , let it be .	Marge Simpson
`` leaves of 4 , eat some more . ''	Homer Simpson
i 'll write you every day .	Lisa Simpson
do n't look in my closet . in fact , stay out of my room all together .	Bart Simpson
if the pets die , do n't replace them . i 'll know !	Lisa Simpson
when do we get to see krusty ?	Bart Simpson
you can have the shower to yourself , homie . i 'm finished .	Marge Simpson
oh no you 're not .	Homer Simpson
ohhh ...	Marge Simpson
he-he-he .	Homer Simpson
whoa ! !	Marge Simpson
this is a little more rustic than i expected .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not worried , lis . you know why ? because of this ...	Bart Simpson
the krusty brand seal of approval . you can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of krusty the clown .	Bart Simpson
do n't we get to roast marshmallows ?	Bart Simpson
are you sure that 's safe ?	Lisa Simpson
you 're serving us gruel ?	Lisa Simpson
marge , since the kids left , i lost five pounds !	Homer Simpson
oh , that 's wonderful .	Marge Simpson
and look . new hair !	Homer Simpson
i 'm this close to having a comb-over !	Homer Simpson
i feel like i 'm gon na die , bart .	Lisa Simpson
we 're all gon na die , lis .	Bart Simpson
i meant soon .	Lisa Simpson
so did i .	Bart Simpson
dear kids , i hope this letter finds you well . we are doing great . your father is in the best shape he 's been since ... well , ever .	Marge Simpson
size ... right ... agility !	Homer Simpson
we miss you terribly . i hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home .	Marge Simpson
dear mom and dad , i no longer fear hell , because i 've been to kamp krusty .	Lisa Simpson
our nature hikes have become grim death marches .	Lisa Simpson
our arts and crafts center is , in actuality , a dickensian workhouse .	Lisa Simpson
bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that krusty the clown will come through .	Lisa Simpson
krusty is coming . krusty is coming . krusty is coming .	Bart Simpson
but i am far more pessimistic .	Lisa Simpson
i am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut .	Lisa Simpson
and now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded . so i close by saying , save us ! save us now ! bart and lisa .	Lisa Simpson
ah , kids ' letters from camp .	Homer Simpson
she complains now , but when we go to pick her up , she wo n't want to leave .	Marge Simpson
lisa , i 've been thinking it over , and next summer i am getting a job .	Bart Simpson
oh ... homer , it 's getting late , we 'll miss the fireworks .	Marge Simpson
marge , we 've got all the fireworks we need right here .	Homer Simpson
see , i told you krusty would come . just like i said , heh , heh . he 's gon na bring us food and water and smite our enemies .	Bart Simpson
he 's really having trouble keeping his balance .	Lisa Simpson
that 's not krusty the clown .	Bart Simpson
my chunky brothers , gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom !	Bart Simpson
kowalski !	Lisa Simpson
wiggum !	Lisa Simpson
crandall !	Lisa Simpson
bart , you said you were gon na name it `` camp freedom . ''	Lisa Simpson
ehh , this has more zing .	Bart Simpson
i just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp . can i say `` crappy '' on tv ?	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ? who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom , `` president clown '' ?	Lisa Simpson
i smell bacon . let 's see if he 's wearing a wire .	Bart Simpson
it is the real krusty . look at that pacemaker scar , the cattle skull birthmark , and his famous superfluous nipple .	Lisa Simpson
how could you , krusty ? i 'd never lend my name to an inferior product .	Bart Simpson
krusty , this camp was a nightmare . they fed us gruel , they forced us to make wallets for export , and one of the campers was eaten by a bear .	Bart Simpson
well actually , the bear just ate his hat .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah .	Bart Simpson
kids , i wo n't be home tonight , so i 'm leaving you some low-cal microwavable tv dinners .	Marge Simpson
yuh huh .	Lisa Simpson
doh-kay .	Bart Simpson
i 'm auditioning for a play ! it 's a musical version of `` a streetcar named desire . '' is n't that exciting ?	Marge Simpson
he 's such a bitch .	Bart Simpson
i have n't been in a play since high school , and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults .	Marge Simpson
sounds interesting .	Homer Simpson
you know , i spend all day alone with maggie ... and sometimes it 's like i do n't even exist .	Marge Simpson
sounds interesting .	Homer Simpson
a beaut from butte .	Homer Simpson
nothin ' could be finah .	Homer Simpson
she , uh ... good for her .	Homer Simpson
la-la-la-la-la-la-la .	Marge Simpson
marge keep it down in there .	Homer Simpson

hey look , it 's last year 's winner , deborah jo smallwood !	Lisa Simpson
maggie ! cut that racket !	Homer Simpson

i 'm auditioning for a play .	Marge Simpson
well , this is the first i 've heard about it .	Homer Simpson
i told you several times . it 's a musical version of `` a streetcar named ... ''	Marge Simpson
excuse me , marge . i think that if you told me i would remember ! i mean i 'm not an idiot !	Homer Simpson
well ... i thought i told you..	Marge Simpson

i 'll come home right away . all right , i 'll pick up a bucket of fried chicken ... extra skin , rolls , chocolate cream parfait ...	Marge Simpson
i play an aging southern beauty who 's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law stanley .	Marge Simpson
wow ! my mother the actress . i feel like lucie arnaz-luckinbill .	Lisa Simpson
are there any jive-talking robots in this play ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't think so .	Marge Simpson
bart , do n't ask stupid questions . is there any frontal nudity ?	Homer Simpson
no , homer .	Marge Simpson
i 'm marge simpson , i 'll be playing blanche . i made some peanut butter brownies for everyone .	Marge Simpson
well , i guess a few weeks would n't hurt her .	Marge Simpson
maggie is allergic to strained pears , and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime ...	Marge Simpson
ba-ba ?	Marge Simpson
that sounds awfully harsh .	Marge Simpson
oh , well . be a good girl , maggie .	Marge Simpson
stanley , stop or i 'll tell stella .	Marge Simpson
i 'll twist this bottle in your face ...	Marge Simpson
homer , can you run some lines with me ?	Marge Simpson
make bart do it .	Homer Simpson
it 'll just take a sec .	Marge Simpson
you see , marge , while you 're off in your little world , you forgot that other people have problems too .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , llewellyn . i just ... i just do n't see why blanche should shove a broken bottle in stanley 's face . could n't she just take his abuse with gentle , good humor ?	Marge Simpson
marge , your ride 's here .	Homer Simpson
homer , it 'll just be a few minutes more !	Marge Simpson
stanley stop , or i 'll tell stella .	Marge Simpson
marge , can i get some change for the candy machine ?	Homer Simpson
hey , there 's quarters in here !	Homer Simpson

i 'm sure you wo n't enjoy it . there 's nothing about bowling in the play ... oh wait , there is .	Marge Simpson
probably not much of it .	Homer Simpson
why ca n't you be a little more supportive ?	Marge Simpson
because i do n't care , okay ? i ca n't fake an interest in this , and i 'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects .	Homer Simpson
what kooky projects ?	Marge Simpson
you know , the painting class , the first aid course , that whole lamaze thing .	Homer Simpson

now here 's a tip from blanche you wo n't regret ...	Marge Simpson
hey , look at me ! i 'm blanche dubois !	Bart Simpson

no , homer , you got it just right .	Marge Simpson
hey , you know . i 'm a lot like that guy .	Homer Simpson

yeah , like when i pick my teeth with the mail and stuff ...	Homer Simpson

homer ! are you actually giving up your faith ?	Marge Simpson

hey , what 's the big deal about going to some building every sunday ? i mean , is n't god everywhere ?	Homer Simpson
amen , brother .	Bart Simpson
and do n't you think that the almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week ?	Homer Simpson
tell it , daddy !	Bart Simpson
and what if we picked the wrong religion ? every week we 're just making god madder and madder .	Homer Simpson
testify !	Bart Simpson
lord , my husband is by no means perfect , but he 's a kind , decent man . please show him the error of his ways .	Marge Simpson
marge , come to bed .	Homer Simpson

i 'm not a bad guy . i work hard and i love my kids . so why should i spend half my sunday hearing about how i 'm going to hell ?	Homer Simpson
no . they moved to phoenix .	Homer Simpson
you know what i really hate about church ? those boring sermons .	Homer Simpson
give him one for me .	Homer Simpson
so i figure i should just try to live right , and worship you in my own way .	Homer Simpson
dad , can i ask you a question ?	Lisa Simpson
sure , honey .	Homer Simpson

dad , have you seen the girls they have in those contests ? hubba , hubba .	Bart Simpson
hey , nobody 's prettier than my little girl .	Homer Simpson
you 're looking at her through a father 's eyes .	Marge Simpson

honey , no one 's going to force you to do anything ... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant ?	Marge Simpson
nope .	Lisa Simpson
he sold his ride on the duff blimp .	Marge Simpson
but that ride meant everything to him !	Lisa Simpson
hey there blimpy boy flying through the sky so fancy free --	Homer Simpson
i 'll do it .	Lisa Simpson
she 's beautiful .	Lisa Simpson
i thought those were illegal .	Lisa Simpson
there 's no way i can beat this girl . she 's the jack nicklaus of the pageant circuit .	Lisa Simpson

boy , when lisa comes in , i want you to make a big fuss over how she looks .	Homer Simpson
she 'll see through me like grandma 's underpants .	Bart Simpson
no , she wo n't . when it comes to compliments , women are ravenous , blood-sucking monsters , always wantin ' more , more ! more ! and if you give it to 'em , you 'll get plenty back in return .	Homer Simpson

and now for your triumphant walk down the runway .	Bart Simpson
it 's hopeless .	Lisa Simpson

as little miss springfield , it 's my pleasure to welcome you to america , the land of opportunity .	Lisa Simpson
oh dear . it would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet .	Marge Simpson
i 'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod . unless it 's made out of plastic .	Lisa Simpson
nope . metal .	Bart Simpson
that does n't look like her body .	Bart Simpson
hi fellas .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes ?	Lisa Simpson

dad , you and your stories ... `` bart broke my teeth '' ... `` the nurses are stealing my money '' ... `` this thing on my neck is getting bigger '' ...	Homer Simpson
now this is exactly what bart 's teacher was talking about . our son did something wrong and you look the other way .	Marge Simpson

hey you goats , get outta here !	Homer Simpson
boy , you 're going to have to be punished for this .	Homer Simpson
dad , you could punish me . but that means you 'd have to think of a punishment , sit here and make sure i do it ...	Bart Simpson
or you could let me go play with milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable mexican sitcoms .	Bart Simpson
run along , ya little scamp .	Homer Simpson
jin-gle bells , jin-gle bells ...	Bart Simpson
bart ! why are you doing that ?	Homer Simpson
i'unno .	Bart Simpson

ice cream truck !	Homer Simpson
me , me . i was here first !	Homer Simpson
now , what were we talking about , boy ?	Homer Simpson

yuh - huh .	Bart Simpson
why are you letting him do this ?	Marge Simpson

oh . how convenient .	Homer Simpson
homer , do you want your son to become chief justice of the supreme court or a sleazy male stripper ?	Marge Simpson
ca n't he be both like the late earl warren ?	Homer Simpson
earl warren was n't a stripper .	Marge Simpson
now who 's being naive .	Homer Simpson
look , you have to help discipline your son .	Marge Simpson
all right , marge . i swear to you , the next time he does something wrong i 'll punish him and make it stick .	Homer Simpson
i got my ticket .	Bart Simpson
sorry , but the punishment stands .	Homer Simpson

dad , you got ta let me see that movie . ca n't you just give me a spanking ?	Bart Simpson
come on , go nuts .	Bart Simpson
do n't point that thing at me . i said you 're not going to the movie and i 'm sticking to it .	Homer Simpson
dad , i agree that bart should be punished , but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation . how would you have liked it if someone told you that you could n't watch the moon landing ?	Lisa Simpson
hmm ...	Homer Simpson
yummy , yummy , yummy/ i 've got love in my tummy/ and i feel like lovin ' you ...	Homer Simpson
... love you , such a sweet thing/ good enough to eat thing ...	Homer Simpson
someday you 'll thank me for this , son .	Homer Simpson
not bloody likely .	Bart Simpson
no , it 's true . you know , when i was a boy i really wanted a catcher 's mitt . but , my dad would n't get it for me . so i held my breath until i passed out and banged my head on the coffee table . the doctor thought i might have brain damage .	Homer Simpson
dad , what 's the point of this story ?	Bart Simpson
i like stories .	Homer Simpson
look , can i please go to the movie ?	Bart Simpson
i know my punishment might seem a little harsh , but i ca n't go back on it . you 're welcome to watch anything you want on tv .	Homer Simpson
tv sucks .	Bart Simpson
i know you 're upset right now , so i 'll pretend you did n't say that .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not licked yet . i can entertain myself . no matter how good a movie is , it ca n't compare to the imagination of a small boy .	Bart Simpson
how was it ?	Bart Simpson
it was n't that great .	Lisa Simpson
be honest .	Bart Simpson
it was the greatest movie i 've ever seen in my life . and you would n't believe the celebrities who did cameos . dustin hoffman , michael jackson ... of course they did n't use their real names , but you could tell it was them .	Lisa Simpson
lisa .	Bart Simpson
sorry bart .	Lisa Simpson

homer , we 'd like to talk to you .	Marge Simpson
but then i wo n't be watching tv . you can see the bind i 'm in .	Homer Simpson
dad , you 've got to let bart see that movie . i 've never seen him like this . he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine .	Lisa Simpson
do n't you think i know that ?	Homer Simpson
well , it 's been two months . you laid down the law and i 'm proud of you . but i think we 've gotten through to him .	Marge Simpson
ah , sweet soft-hearted marge . you just ca n't see the big picture . if i stick to my guns , the boy could wind up chief justice of the supreme court . if i fail , the best he could do is judge at a `` mister tight buns '' competition . i ca n't let that happen , i wo n't let that happen and i ca n't let that happen .	Homer Simpson
one for `` itchy and scratchy '' .	Bart Simpson
well , dad , i guess you won .	Bart Simpson
no , son , we both won . you do n't know it now , but i 've started you on the road to somewhere very special .	Homer Simpson
well , i 'll be . the itchy and scratchy movie .	Bart Simpson
come on . what d'ya say ?	Bart Simpson

eh , too predictable . the way i see it , instead of shampoo itchy covers scratchy 's hair with barbecue sauce ... opens a box of flesh-eating ants ... and the rest writes itself .	Bart Simpson
finished . now all we have to do is put our names on it .	Lisa Simpson
fine . put my name first .	Bart Simpson
no way .	Lisa Simpson
all right , then to decide it , i propose a race around the world . meet me at luster square at noon tomorrow . the queen herself shall drop the checkered flag .	Bart Simpson
look there 's only one reasonable way to settle this : rock , paper , scissors .	Lisa Simpson
rock .	Bart Simpson
paper .	Lisa Simpson
bart , they rejected our script .	Lisa Simpson
i guess we 're just not cut out to be writers .	Bart Simpson
maybe he just does n't take us seriously 'cause we 're kids . let 's put a grownup 's name on it .	Lisa Simpson
well , how about grampa ? he 's pretty out of it . he let those guys use his check book for a whole year .	Bart Simpson

dad , can we talk to grampa alone for a minute ?	Bart Simpson
all right . but if he starts to wig out , try to lure him into the cellar .	Homer Simpson
... then we put your name on the script and sent it in .	Lisa Simpson
did n't you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing ?	Bart Simpson
grampa , we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways .	Lisa Simpson
do we have a deal ?	Bart Simpson

wow , it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons .	Lisa Simpson
will this be on the test ?	Homer Simpson
nooooooo !	Homer Simpson

beans , beans , the musical fruit / the more you eat the more you toot ...	Bart Simpson

whacking day is coming .	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo ! the greatest day of the year .	Homer Simpson

deformed ? why did n't you say so ? they should call this book `` johnny deformed ! ''	Bart Simpson
`` hundreds would die , but not the thing they died for : ' a man can stand up ... ' '' wow .	Bart Simpson

lisa , maybe if i 'm part of that mob , i can help steer it in wise directions . now , where 's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn ?	Homer Simpson
if the snakes were in here we could protect them .	Lisa Simpson
well , according to this , snakes `` hear '' by sensing vibrations in the ground . so , if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass , those snakes 'll be in here like oprah on a baked ham .	Bart Simpson
oh , good idea ! let 's see ... bass , bass ... `` tiny tim '' ... `` the chipmunks greatest hits '' ... `` a castrato christmas '' ...	Lisa Simpson

what ?	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe you 're not still popular .	Lisa Simpson
what 'd you do ... screw up like the beatles and say you were bigger than jesus ?	Bart Simpson
all the time . it was the title of our second album !	Homer Simpson

what up , marge ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm watching a videotape that could change our lives .	Marge Simpson
marge , can i go outside and play ?	Homer Simpson
shhh !	Marge Simpson
that video really opened my eyes . i can see that i 'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit . by nagging you when you do foolish things , i just enable your life-script .	Marge Simpson
and that sends me into a shame spiral .	Homer Simpson
exactly ! so from now on , i 'm going to quit nagging and have more fun .	Marge Simpson
homer , did you eat my whole pan of brownies ?	Marge Simpson
uh-oh . you 're in for it now , dad .	Bart Simpson
marge , i 'm feeling a lot of shame right now .	Homer Simpson
i 'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame .	Marge Simpson
and i feel that you hear my shame .	Homer Simpson
i 'm feeling annoyance and frustration , but also tolerance .	Marge Simpson
i feel validated by that .	Homer Simpson
good . i 'm glad we had this talk .	Marge Simpson
me too .	Homer Simpson
wow ! for free , `` surplus drums of mayonnaise from operation desert storm . ''	Homer Simpson
brad goodman is coming to town !	Marge Simpson

well , here we are at the brad goodman lecture .	Homer Simpson
we know , dad .	Lisa Simpson
i just thought i 'd remind everybody . after all , we did agree to attend his self-help seminar .	Homer Simpson
what an odd thing to say .	Bart Simpson
it sure does !	Homer Simpson
a human going !	Bart Simpson
bart ! be quiet !	Marge Simpson
i 'unno .	Bart Simpson
i do what i feel like .	Bart Simpson
what ! ?	Lisa Simpson
earth to boring guy .	Bart Simpson
thank you . very , very much .	Homer Simpson
oh , thank you .	Marge Simpson
rudiger .	Bart Simpson
his name is bart .	Marge Simpson
this is madness . he 's just peddling a bunch of easy answers .	Lisa Simpson
lis , today i am a god .	Bart Simpson
is that why you 're sitting on an ice cream sandwich ?	Lisa Simpson
ewww ... uhh .	Bart Simpson
it was ...	Bart Simpson
aw geez . everybody 's a comedian .	Bart Simpson
i 'm blue . time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass .	Bart Simpson
oh , man .	Bart Simpson
lis , everyone in town is acting like me , so why does it suck ?	Bart Simpson
it 's simple , bart . you 've defined yourself as a rebel . and in the absence of a repressive milieu , your societal niche has been co-opted .	Lisa Simpson
i see .	Bart Simpson
ever since that self-help guy came to town , you 've lost your identity . you 've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix , one-hour-photo , instant-oatmeal society .	Lisa Simpson
what 's the answer ?	Bart Simpson
well , this is your chance to develop a new and better identity . may i suggest `` good-natured doormat ? ''	Lisa Simpson
sounds good , sis . just tell me what to do .	Bart Simpson
this is great . i can finally look like i want and not get hassled by the man .	Homer Simpson
skateboards ? you copycat wannabes .	Bart Simpson
ow !	Bart Simpson
hey , i hear ya , buddy .	Homer Simpson
uh , i do n't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation , but my inner critic says you should 've done your job !	Marge Simpson
i knew it . if only i had nagged more ...	Marge Simpson
eep .	Bart Simpson
hey , boy ! in here !	Homer Simpson
hold on , son .	Homer Simpson
so long , suckers !	Homer Simpson
no , we 're not .	Homer Simpson
ah ... boy , if only bart had been a better role model for everyone .	Homer Simpson
that 's not fair . the lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities .	Marge Simpson
no ! self-improvement can be achieved , but not with a quick-fix . it 's a long , arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery .	Lisa Simpson
that 's what i 've been saying . we 're all fine the way we are .	Homer Simpson
oooh , it 's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time .	Homer Simpson
crank it , homer .	Bart Simpson
ah , mcgarnigal . eases the pain .	Homer Simpson
it means he gets results , you stupid chief .	Homer Simpson
dad , sit down .	Lisa Simpson
oh , i 'm sorry .	Homer Simpson
keep cool , simpson . be in the game , but not of the game .	Bart Simpson
oh . i 'm out of money .	Bart Simpson
oh , aw , man , how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon ?	Bart Simpson
ah , finally a little quiet time , to read some of my old favorites .	Homer Simpson
`` honey roasted peanuts . ingredients : salt , artificial honey-roasting agents , pressed peanut sweepings . '' mmmmm .	Homer Simpson
homer , i have to go out to pick up something for dinner .	Marge Simpson
steak ?	Homer Simpson
money 's too tight for steak .	Marge Simpson

oh , twenty dollars . i wanted a peanut .	Homer Simpson
explain how .	Homer Simpson

you know , this is wearing a bit thin .	Bart Simpson
maybe a plane exploded .	Bart Simpson
one that 's made : entirely out of syrup .	Bart Simpson
just make it happen .	Bart Simpson
wowww ... that 's good squishee .	Bart Simpson

springfield , springfield -- !	Bart Simpson
new york is that-a-way , man .	Bart Simpson
mmmmm ... free goo .	Homer Simpson
ohhh ... my head ... .	Bart Simpson
tsk , tsk . the remorse of the sugar junkie .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't remember anything .	Bart Simpson
really ? not even this ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , no . i must have joined the junior campers !	Bart Simpson
the few , the proud , the geeky .	Lisa Simpson
boy , a man on a squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things .	Bart Simpson
okay look , i made a terrible mistake . i wandered into a junior camper recruitment center . but what 's done is done . i 've made my bed and now i 've got to weasel out of it .	Bart Simpson
i know you think the junior campers are square and ... `` uncool , '' but they also do a lot of neat things , like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies .	Marge Simpson
marge , do n't discourage the boy . weaseling out of things is important to learn . it 's what separates us from the animals . except the weasel .	Homer Simpson
all i 've got ta do is take this uniform back after school .	Bart Simpson
yeah . whatever .	Bart Simpson
oh no . woe is me , my precious uniform .	Bart Simpson
um , mrs. krabappel ... ?	Bart Simpson
i 'd love to stay , but this uniform carries certain responsibilities .	Bart Simpson
enjoy your test .	Bart Simpson
hel-lo , alternative to testing !	Bart Simpson
nooo !	Bart Simpson
i 'm outta here , man .	Bart Simpson
you guys get to play with knives ?	Bart Simpson
cool ! a spork !	Bart Simpson
aw , who needs a cruddy knife anyway ?	Bart Simpson
knives are boring .	Bart Simpson
seems like everywhere i look people are enjoying knives .	Bart Simpson
do n't do what donny do n't does . they could 've made this clearer .	Bart Simpson
they wo n't let you have any fun .	Bart Simpson
well if it is n't the leader of the wiener patrol , boning up on his nerd lessons .	Homer Simpson
homer , you should be more supportive .	Marge Simpson
you 're right , marge . good work , boy .	Homer Simpson
egghead likes his bookie wook !	Homer Simpson

the guys who wrote this show do n't know squat . itchy should have tied scratchy 's tongue with a taut-line hitch , not a sheet-bend .	Bart Simpson

heh heh . you do n't have a son .	Homer Simpson
look , homer wo n't want to go , so just ask him , and he 'll say no . then it 'll be his fault .	Bart Simpson
i do n't want to go , so if he asks me to go , i 'll just say yes .	Homer Simpson
shut up , brain , or i 'll stab you with a q-tip .	Homer Simpson
dad , i really want you to come on this trip with me !	Bart Simpson

lisa 's costume . homer , i did n't realize . i 'm so sorry .	Marge Simpson
marge , i want you to admit you have a gambling problem .	Homer Simpson
you know , you 're right , homer . maybe i should get some professional help .	Marge Simpson
no no , that 's too expensive . just do n't do it anymore .	Homer Simpson
ca n't talk . robbed . go hell .	Homer Simpson
you know , marge , for the first time in our marriage , i can finally look down my nose at you . you have a gambling problem .	Homer Simpson
that 's true . will you forgive me ?	Marge Simpson
oh sure ... remember when i got caught stealing all those watches from sears ?	Homer Simpson
well , that 's nothing , because you have a gambling problem ! and remember when i let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like santa claus ?	Homer Simpson
well , you have a gambling problem !	Homer Simpson
homer , when you forgive someone , you ca n't throw it back at them like that .	Marge Simpson
aw , what a gyp .	Homer Simpson

homer ! that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom .	Marge Simpson
oh , you 've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em .	Homer Simpson
well ... yes , i do . but they 're all heirlooms , too .	Marge Simpson
the burglar even took my stamp collection .	Bart Simpson
you had a stamp collection ?	Lisa Simpson
bart 's pain is funny , but mine is n't . that saxophone was my one creative outlet . it was the only way i could truly express myself .	Lisa Simpson
shhh , quiet lisa .	Homer Simpson
hey , the burglar left his calling card .	Bart Simpson
you have just been robbed by the springfield cat burglar ... cute .	Marge Simpson

let me check my reason list .	Homer Simpson
yep . it 's on here .	Homer Simpson

alright , these are our new family security rules : be home before dark , and make sure you 're not followed , lock all doors and windows .	Homer Simpson
and do n't take candy from strangers .	Marge Simpson
marge , they 're only human .	Homer Simpson
what 's the point of all these precautions ? i 've already lost the only thing that matters to me .	Lisa Simpson
oh lisa , stop pining for your saxophone . i got you another instrument .	Homer Simpson
what , this jug ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , never , ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down .	Homer Simpson
aw , honey . i did n't realize how much that horn meant to you . do n't worry . daddy 's gon na get it back . i do n't know how , but i 'll figure out something .	Homer Simpson
thank you .	Lisa Simpson
you know lisa , music helps daddy think .	Homer Simpson
i dunno . can you swing a sack of door knobs ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm someone else !	Homer Simpson
we do n't need a thinker , we need a doer . someone who 'll act without considering the consequences .	Homer Simpson
sorry , dad . you 're too old .	Homer Simpson
aw , dad , you 've done a lot of great things , but you 're a very old man now , and old people are useless . are n't they ? are n't they ? huh ? yes they are . yes they are ...	Homer Simpson
i do n't think the guns are a good idea , homer .	Marge Simpson
marge , we 're responsible adults and ...	Homer Simpson
... and if a group of responsible adults ca n't handle firearms in a responsible way ...	Homer Simpson
sorry .	Bart Simpson
okay , we 've got the secret vigilante handshake . now we need code names . i 'll be `` cueball . '' skinner can be `` eightball '' , barney will be `` twelveball , '' and moe , you can be `` cueball . ''	Homer Simpson
no , we 're forming a vigilante group .	Homer Simpson
put this in your pipe and smoke it .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! woo hoo hoo hoo !	Homer Simpson
woo hoo , hoo ! take that maynard g. krebs !	Homer Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson
okay , men , it 's time to clean up this town .	Homer Simpson

it 's not just a megaphone , dad . it 's a rapmaster 2000 .	Bart Simpson
never mind the commercials . just give it to me . i 've got to whip this neighborhood into shape .	Homer Simpson
move along there .	Homer Simpson
return to your homes and places of businesses !	Homer Simpson
hey you , where 'd you get that saxophone ?	Homer Simpson

no burning leaves without a permit !	Homer Simpson
too late .	Homer Simpson
you better have a good reason for doing that , boy .	Homer Simpson
you 're in . here 's the sack .	Homer Simpson
so i said to him , `` look buddy , your car was upside down when we got here . and as for your grandma , she should n't have mouthed off like that . ''	Homer Simpson
dad , do n't you see you 're abusing your power like all vigilantes ? i mean , if you 're the police , who will police the police ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'unno . coast guard ?	Homer Simpson
homer , was n't the whole point to catch the cat burglar ?	Marge Simpson
and i still do n't have my saxophone .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , the mob is working on getting your saxophone back , but we 've also expanded into other important areas .	Homer Simpson
literacy programs ... preserving our beloved covered bridges ... world domination ...	Homer Simpson
world domination ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , that might be a typo .	Homer Simpson
aw , people can come up with statistics to prove anything , kent . forty percent of all people know that .	Homer Simpson
oh , kent , i 'd be lying if i said my men were n't committing crimes .	Homer Simpson
y'ello .	Homer Simpson
uh ... marge ?	Homer Simpson
why you monster ! and you have my daughter 's saxophone too !	Homer Simpson
oh sorry . i 'm a little nervous .	Homer Simpson
listen , mr. cat burglar , i vow to go without sleep and guard the springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes , from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time .	Homer Simpson
we 'll be right back .	Homer Simpson
dad , the best way for you to help is to set a good example . just stand around and do n't steal anything .	Homer Simpson
hey !	Homer Simpson
he 'll show .	Homer Simpson
it 's his job .	Homer Simpson
he 's a burglar .	Homer Simpson
well , mr. cat burglar , you 'd like to get in here , would n't you ? there 's just one little problem . thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named homer j. sim -- oh my god ! underage kids drinking beer without a permit !	Homer Simpson
asleep at the switch ! i was n't asleep ! i was drunk !	Homer Simpson
i believe you , dad .	Bart Simpson
well , no matter what the paper says , i still have a job to do .	Homer Simpson

aw , dad , i could kiss you .	Homer Simpson
no wait ! i know where the burglar is !	Homer Simpson

actually , it was n't me . it was my dad , grampa .	Homer Simpson
thank you . and thank you , dad . you got it back , just like you said you would .	Lisa Simpson
i caught the cat burglar . i caught the cat burglar . that means you . you are the cat burglar .	Homer Simpson

`` frightfully sorry , but there is no hidden treasure . i have already used this time to escape from your jail . fondest wishes . '' oh , i ca n't make out this signature .	Homer Simpson
we 'll dig our way out !	Homer Simpson
ahh , the morning horoscope . `` today will be a day like every other day . '' it just gets worse and worse .	Homer Simpson
bart , i 've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune .	Marge Simpson
jawohl , mein mommandant .	Bart Simpson
why are you so happy ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , you kids got ta go to school . i got ta go to work . the only one who has it easy is marge .	Homer Simpson
you 're right , bart . school is for losers .	Lisa Simpson
and that 's how i cured all disease , ended war , and reunited the entire cast of tv 's `` facts of life '' , including long time hold-out , tootie .	Lisa Simpson
sounds like another pulitzer for me to polish .	Bart Simpson
hush , field trip boy .	Lisa Simpson

oh , it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip . think you 'd be interested in a career as a box maker ?	Marge Simpson
well that 'll always be the dream , but for now i got a job in the show business . from now on i 'll be helping krusty the clown after school .	Bart Simpson
i do n't know , bart . you 're only ten .	Marge Simpson
i 've got a weekend job helping the poor . and i 'm only eight .	Lisa Simpson
that 's not a job . it 's a waste of time . what can poor people pay ya ? nothin ' ! what satisfaction do you get from helping 'em ? none ! who wants to help poor people anyway ? nobody !	Homer Simpson
so , anyway , can i , mom ? can i take the job ?	Bart Simpson
well ...	Marge Simpson

hello , everybody . i 'm archie bell and i 'm also the drells . we got a new song called , 'tighten up ' and this is the music you tighten up with .	Homer Simpson
yes , son , you can have an electric guitar , just like your old man .	Homer Simpson

i 'm telling ya , i do work on the krusty show . look at the credits .	Bart Simpson
there 's my name . right there . bart simpson .	Bart Simpson

i did n't do it .	Bart Simpson
i did n't do it .	Bart Simpson
this biography of bart came out awfully quickly . it 's not even about him .	Lisa Simpson
sure it is . look at the cover .	Bart Simpson
but inside it 's mostly about ross perot . and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial .	Lisa Simpson
ah . oliver north . he was just poured into that uniform .	Homer Simpson
i did n't do it / i did n't do it .	Bart Simpson
uh ... i never thought i 'd say this , but should n't we be learning something ?	Bart Simpson
i did n't do it ?	Bart Simpson
come on , lisa . say something funny .	Homer Simpson
like what ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , something stupid like bart would say . bucka bucka or woozle wozzle . something like that .	Homer Simpson
forget it , dad . if i ever become famous , i want it to be for something worthwhile , not because of some obnoxious fad .	Lisa Simpson
obnoxious fad ?	Bart Simpson
aw , do n't worry , son , they said the same thing about urkel ... that little snot . boy i 'd like to smack that kid .	Homer Simpson
what the hell are you readin ' books for ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm doing the conan o'brien show and i wan na have some intelligent stuff to talk about .	Bart Simpson
do n't forget to say `` i did n't do it '' .	Homer Simpson
dad , there 's more to me than just a catchphrase .	Bart Simpson
how do you figure boy ?	Homer Simpson
watch the conan o'brien show . you 'll see .	Bart Simpson
all right , but after leno i 'm all laughed out you know .	Homer Simpson
you know , conan , i have a lot to say . i 'm not just a one line wonder . did you know that a section of rainforest the size of kansas is burned every single ...	Bart Simpson
i did n't do it .	Bart Simpson

yargghh !	Bart Simpson
bart , it 's time to get ready for the show .	Marge Simpson

that dog can sell anything .	Homer Simpson
honey , i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over , but you should n't . you 're making people happy . and that 's a very hard thing to do .	Marge Simpson
you 're right , mom . i should n't let this bother me . i 'm in television now . it 's my job to be repetitive ... my job , my job . repetitiveness is my job . i am gon na go out there tonight and give the best performance of my life .	Bart Simpson

the best performance of my life .	Bart Simpson
i did n't do it !	Bart Simpson
i did n't do it .	Bart Simpson
woozle wozzle .	Bart Simpson

i saved these for you , bart . you 'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world 's special little guy .	Marge Simpson
thanks , mom .	Bart Simpson
and now you can go back to just being you , instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase .	Lisa Simpson
aye carumba !	Bart Simpson
if anyone wants me i 'll be in my room .	Lisa Simpson
what kind of catchphrase is that ?	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! cheap meat !	Homer Simpson
oooh , this one 's open !	Homer Simpson
oh , stomach churning ... bowels clenching ... not much time . must finish .	Homer Simpson
your old meat made me sick !	Homer Simpson
this shrimp is n't frozen and it smells funny .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson

bor-ing .	Homer Simpson
dad , you should blow the whistle on the kwik-e-mart .	Lisa Simpson

no way , man no way , man . get yourself another patsy , man . no way am i wearing a freakin ' wire .	Homer Simpson

oh .	Homer Simpson
you 're selling what now ?	Homer Simpson
you ca n't sell that . karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos .	Homer Simpson
is he still out there ?	Homer Simpson
yes , he 's raking leaves .	Marge Simpson
what ? that 's your job . if he starts doing lisa 's wood chopping ...	Homer Simpson
if he wants to make it up to you so badly , i think you should let him .	Marge Simpson
okay , okay i 'll let him . but then i get a chipwich , okay ?	Homer Simpson
it certainly is exotic .	Marge Simpson
lisa , is that too spicy for you ?	Marge Simpson
i can see through time .	Lisa Simpson
stop being such babies . you ca n't be afraid to try new things . for instance , tonight i 'm using a ... apu , what do you call this thing again ?	Homer Simpson
outrageous .	Homer Simpson
uh , i like to keep a lollipop there .	Homer Simpson
apu , we usually store our cans in the cupboard .	Marge Simpson
mmm corn . have n't had that in awhile .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , delicious corn .	Bart Simpson
bye !	Lisa Simpson
hmm . oh , we 're low on milk for maggie . you wan na come with me to the kwik-e-mart ?	Marge Simpson
well , i guess we could go to that new monstromart ...	Marge Simpson
ooh . that 's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg .	Marge Simpson
but that 's the longest .	Marge Simpson
pass the chutney .	Homer Simpson
apu , you 've been so helpful . if it were n't for him , we 'd still be in line at the monstromart .	Marge Simpson
and he taught me how to play the shenai .	Lisa Simpson
that 's even worse than the album grampa released .	Homer Simpson
and he taught me how to do this .	Bart Simpson
i got out of school because i told them i was mangled in a car wreck .	Bart Simpson
well you deserve it . all these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart .	Homer Simpson
ub . apu friend me good .	Homer Simpson
i think what my father 's saying is you 're like a member of the family now .	Lisa Simpson
that 's okay .	Homer Simpson
their floors are sticky-mart .	Marge Simpson
they made dad sicky-mart .	Lisa Simpson
let 's hurl a bricky-mart !	Bart Simpson
that kwik-e-mart 's a real ... .	Homer Simpson
everything really wrapped up nicely . much quicker than usual .	Homer Simpson
i guess we 've learned that happiness is wherever you find it .	Marge Simpson
and we 've all found happiness ... every one of us .	Homer Simpson
hey , what 's that sound ?	Homer Simpson
hey , he 's not happy at all . he lied to us through song . i hate when people do that .	Homer Simpson
is n't there anything you can do to get your job back ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm coming with you . i got you fired , it 's the least i can do ... well , the least i can do is absolutely nothing . but i 'll go you one better and come along .	Homer Simpson

are we in india yet ?	Homer Simpson
are we in india yet ?	Homer Simpson
are we in india yet ?	Homer Simpson
this is n't very convenient .	Homer Simpson
are you really the head of the kwik-e-mart ?	Homer Simpson
really ?	Homer Simpson
you ?	Homer Simpson
well that was a big bust ... is he really the head of the kwik-e-mart ?	Homer Simpson
no need to apologize , apu . it was as much my fault as it was yours .	Homer Simpson
okay , apu , i accept your apology .	Homer Simpson
dad , dad !	Lisa Simpson
what 'd ya bring ? what 'd ya bring ?	Lisa Simpson
how did it go ?	Marge Simpson
fine . oh , i mean not good .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , apu . but remember , who needs a kwik-e-mart --	Lisa Simpson
apu , if it 'll make you feel any better , i 've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish flanders was dead .	Homer Simpson
oh , that 'll work out great . we 're out of lucky charms .	Marge Simpson
that sounds like a good movie .	Marge Simpson
hey , let 's all hug apu .	Homer Simpson
awww .	Lisa Simpson

thanks . `` mr. simpson . stop . your constant letters are becoming a nuisance . stop . if you do not cease , i will be forced to pursue legal action . stop . signed , boris karloff , hollywood , california . ''	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
dad , we 'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes , but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them .	Homer Simpson
look , maggie ! it 's sgt . thug 's mountaintop command post , complete with death-bringer missiles that really launch !	Homer Simpson
that toy is n't safe for a baby like maggie .	Marge Simpson
ah , come on , marge , you 're way too ...	Homer Simpson

we 're gon na rock , gon na rock around the clock to-nighhhttt !	Homer Simpson
thank you , thank you very much !	Homer Simpson
i 'm warning you , mom -- i may get a little crazy .	Lisa Simpson
i understand , honey . when i was your age there was a ...	Marge Simpson
hey , horse-face ! git yer ugly pie-hooks off that summer fun set !	Lisa Simpson
hm . i do n't know if it 's a good idea to do that while you 're driving .	Marge Simpson
marge , that 's what i bought it for !	Homer Simpson
thanks for buying us these toys , grampa .	Lisa Simpson
yes . but there 's more .	Homer Simpson
dad , i love you , but : you are a weird , sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya .	Homer Simpson
a hush falls over the general assembly as stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address .	Lisa Simpson
come on , stacy . i 've waited my whole life to hear you speak . do n't you have anything relevant to say ?	Lisa Simpson
right on ! say it , sister !	Bart Simpson
it 's not funny , bart ! millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act ! that they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty , land a rich husband , and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband ! !	Lisa Simpson
just what i was gon na say .	Bart Simpson
do n't you people see anything wrong with what malibu stacy says ?	Lisa Simpson
no , celeste , i mean the things she says are sexist .	Lisa Simpson
they can not keep making dolls like this ! something has to be done !	Lisa Simpson
lisa -- ordinarily , i 'd say you should stand up for what you believe in , but you have been doing that an awful lot lately .	Marge Simpson
yeah , you made us march in that gay rights parade .	Bart Simpson
and we ca n't watch fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in syria .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you 're just gon na stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this , this is their role model .	Lisa Simpson
i had a malibu stacy when i was little , and i turned out all right . now let 's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream .	Marge Simpson
that 's it ! i 'm calling the company !	Lisa Simpson
mom ! we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in person !	Lisa Simpson
honey , you 're not going to throw red paint at the executives , are you ? the keebler people were very upset ...	Marge Simpson
i have one .	Lisa Simpson
is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by malibu stacy intentional , or is it just a horrible mistake ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's awful being a kid . no one listens to you .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm a white male , aged eighteen to forty-nine . everyone listens to me ! no matter how dumb my suggestions are .	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm not gon na accomplish anything just sitting here --	Lisa Simpson
action ! i 've got to talk to that woman who invented malibu stacy and see if i can get her to --	Lisa Simpson
you 're getting a job .	Lisa Simpson
i thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of malibu stacy .	Lisa Simpson
thanks .	Lisa Simpson
no , it could n't be ...	Lisa Simpson
excuse me . miss lovell ? i 'd like to talk to you about malibu stacy .	Lisa Simpson
am i the first ?	Lisa Simpson
i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of little girls .	Lisa Simpson
change what she says . it 's your company .	Lisa Simpson
that 's awful !	Lisa Simpson
but you are malibu stacy , and as long as she has your name , you have a responsibility . i 'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the simpson name on it .	Lisa Simpson
but if you can learn from malibu stacy 's mistakes , so can everyone . i 'm sure we can think of something together . c'mon !	Lisa Simpson
no you 're not ! uh , i 'll come back tomorrow .	Lisa Simpson
i 've got the solution -- you and i are gon na make our own talking doll . she 'll have the wisdom of gertrude stein and the wit of cathy guisewite , the tenacity of nina totenberg and the common sense of elizabeth cady stanton . and to top it off , the down-to-earth good looks of eleanor roosevelt !	Lisa Simpson
make sure you get my mom 's hair just right .	Lisa Simpson
how about me ?	Lisa Simpson
how about me ?	Bart Simpson

what 's so special about this game anyway ? it 's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville . they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall . they made the world 's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall .	Lisa Simpson
heh , heh , heh . yeah they swore they 'd get us back by spiking our water supply . but they did n't have the guts .	Homer Simpson
oooh , the walls are melting again .	Marge Simpson

ca n't talk ... see flanders ... later sex .	Homer Simpson
hiya , flanders ! oooh ... dinner ! may i join you ?	Homer Simpson
oh , yeah . a judge made me do that once , too . stupid lack of public urinals . hey , just so you do n't have to suffer alone , i 'm comin ' with ya .	Homer Simpson
but ... all right .	Homer Simpson
c'mon ! we 've been here for fifteen minutes . ca n't you see they 're sucking the life out of us ?	Homer Simpson
ah , for some reason , moe 's is always closed on wednesdays .	Homer Simpson
come on , come on , just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here . oh , i can do it faster that that .	Homer Simpson
homey , i 'm very proud of you , but do n't you think you 're spending too much time with ned ? your family needs you too .	Marge Simpson
oh of course you 'd say something like that , marge . you 've hated ned for years . in fact , you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe .	Homer Simpson
that was you !	Marge Simpson
love , marge . do n't hate . love .	Homer Simpson
the flanders are a buncha geeks , man .	Bart Simpson
the flanderses are not geeks ! okay , rod and todd are ... and the wife has a thing for me , but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility . but we 've got to give this thing a chance . i want the two families to take a trip together this weekend .	Homer Simpson
no way , josã© !	Bart Simpson
yes way .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , bart . it seems like every week something odd happens to the simpsons . my advice is to ride it out , make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we 'll be back to where we started from , ready for another wacky adventure .	Lisa Simpson
ay caramba !	Bart Simpson
that 's the spirit .	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry , i brought my rappin ' ronnie reagan tape . it always makes the trip go faster .	Homer Simpson
ha , ha . you know something , he did say 'well ' a lot .	Homer Simpson
more . no , no , keep comin ' . more ... more ... right there ! let her go !	Homer Simpson
okay , let 's go boating !	Homer Simpson
they 're fine .	Homer Simpson
there . i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch .	Marge Simpson
we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board .	Lisa Simpson
but , why would the advisory board give us bad advice ?	Marge Simpson
aw it 's okay , there 's no sugar in pixie sticks . trust me .	Bart Simpson
i 'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the simpsons and the flanders . if this were a more perfect world , we 'd all be known as the flimpsons .	Homer Simpson
so , here 's to my best friend , ned .	Homer Simpson
food fight !	Homer Simpson
yeah !	Bart Simpson
whatcha doin ' ?	Homer Simpson
okay . but at least let me take the boat out for one last spin !	Homer Simpson
too late .	Homer Simpson

hey flanders , over here . i got us some kick-ass seats .	Homer Simpson
i live to give .	Homer Simpson
stop it ! stop it ! stop it ! how dare you talk about ned flanders like that ! he 's a wonderful , kind , caring man . maybe even more so than me . there have been times when i 've lost patience with him , even lashed out at him . but this man has turned every cheek on his body . if everyone here were like ned flanders , there 'd be no need for heaven . we 'd already be there .	Homer Simpson
that was a very nice thing you did , homey .	Marge Simpson
right back atcha , buddy .	Homer Simpson
now how 'bout that game at the pitch ' n putt ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't get it , lis . you said everything would be back to normal , but homer and flanders are still friends .	Bart Simpson
yeah . maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures .	Lisa Simpson
guess what , everyone ? ! my great uncle boris died and left us his old country house . there 's only one catch they say - it 's haunted . but i 'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there .	Homer Simpson
get lost , flanders .	Homer Simpson
see , i told ya . there 's nothin ' to worry about . this place is n't ...	Homer Simpson
sandwich .	Marge Simpson
underpants .	Marge Simpson
bowling ball ... more underpants ...	Marge Simpson
hi , mom .	Lisa Simpson
hi , mom .	Homer Simpson

and i 'm going to the park to jam with the little white girls blues quartet . wan na come with me , daddy-o ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'd love to honey , but daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today .	Homer Simpson

son , when you participate in sporting events , it 's not whether you win or lose . it 's how drunk you get .	Homer Simpson
gotcha . well , got ta go .	Bart Simpson
me too .	Lisa Simpson
uh , it 's hard for us to leave when you 're standing there , mom .	Bart Simpson
push her down , son .	Homer Simpson
no one 's going anywhere . we 're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom .	Marge Simpson
oh dear god , no .	Homer Simpson
i think you 'll find that escape is impossible . now each one of you take a floor and get started .	Marge Simpson
i call the basement .	Homer Simpson
fine .	Marge Simpson
i 'm tired . i 'm hungry . ca n't we just buy a new house ?	Bart Simpson
oh bart . cleaning does n't have to be a chore . here ... work to the music .	Marge Simpson
amen , ernie .	Bart Simpson
all done .	Homer Simpson
you 're not done . i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides .	Marge Simpson
are you mad , woman ? you never know when an old calendar might come in handy . sure it 's not nineteen eighty-five right now , but who knows what tomorrow will bring ? and these tv guides ... so many memories .	Homer Simpson
`` gomer upsets sergeant carter . '' ooooh , i 'll never forget that episode !	Homer Simpson
shazam .	Homer Simpson
stop remembering tv and get back to work .	Marge Simpson
what 's the point of all this cleaning ? are we so vain ?	Homer Simpson
they 're having a great time and i 'm stuck in here .	Lisa Simpson
use only in a well ventilated area .	Homer Simpson
shove it , buddy .	Homer Simpson
homer , what 's going on down there ?	Marge Simpson
nothing .	Homer Simpson
then stop screaming so loud .	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
kbbl is gon na give me something stupid !	Bart Simpson
ca n't tie up the line , grampa .	Bart Simpson
there ! is n't that a lot better ? now you can do whatever you want . but do n't mess up the house .	Marge Simpson
we wo n't .	Lisa Simpson
y'ello .	Homer Simpson
kbbl is gon na give me something stupid !	Bart Simpson
y'ello ?	Homer Simpson
i won ! i won !	Bart Simpson
where 's my elephant ? !	Bart Simpson
well , all that money sounds mighty tempting , marty . but i think i 'm gon na have to go with the elephant .	Bart Simpson
he 's taking the elephant instead of the money .	Homer Simpson
i want the elephant .	Bart Simpson
heh , heh . stick it to the man . no , wait !	Homer Simpson
we 'll call you back ! bart ! with ten thousand dollars we 'd be millionaires . we could buy all kinds of useful things , like ... ... love .	Homer Simpson
or double-ply windows ! they look just like regular windows but they 'll save us four percent on our heating bill ...	Marge Simpson
well , they will .	Marge Simpson
you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing . which is that it 's wrong to imprison an animal .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , go to your room .	Homer Simpson
eh , either way .	Bart Simpson
umm ... no .	Bart Simpson
uh , gentlemen , i am not leaving without my elephant .	Bart Simpson
hey !	Bart Simpson
wee !	Homer Simpson
where 's my elephant !	Bart Simpson
where 's my elephant !	Bart Simpson
where 's my elephant ? !	Bart Simpson
whoa !	Bart Simpson
homer , it looks like it could gore .	Marge Simpson
heh , heh , it does look like al gore .	Homer Simpson
he smells worse than anything ! hey , you ! elephant ! lift me up on your back , man .	Bart Simpson
bart ! ! !	Marge Simpson
cool ! he tried to kill me !	Bart Simpson
i really think this is a bad idea .	Marge Simpson
marge , i agree with you , in theory . in theory communism works . in theory .	Homer Simpson
look , he thinks he 's people .	Bart Simpson
i think i 'm gon na call him stampy .	Bart Simpson
what 's he yelling about ?	Homer Simpson
he 's hungry . here you go , stampy . eat it slow . it has to last for ...	Lisa Simpson
you ate it too fast .	Lisa Simpson
maybe if we tied it down so it could n't move it would n't get so hungry .	Homer Simpson
you ca n't do that , dad . it 's cruel .	Lisa Simpson
oh , everything 's cruel according to you . keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel . pulling on his tail is cruel . yelling in his ears is cruel . everything is cruel . so excuse me if i 'm cruel .	Homer Simpson
now i 've had my head in an elephant , a hippo and a giant sloth .	Homer Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
he ca n't just eat peanuts , dad . he needs plants to live .	Lisa Simpson
plants , eh ?	Homer Simpson
strip the bark now , stampy .	Bart Simpson
hey , any more arboretums around here ?	Homer Simpson
that bird ! he 's killing the elephant ! stop him !	Homer Simpson
no , dad . he 's grooming him .	Lisa Simpson
grooming him , eh ?	Homer Simpson
ew , homer , there is a bird on your head ?	Marge Simpson
i know . he 's grooming me . mmm ... elephant fresh .	Homer Simpson
g'night , stampy .	Bart Simpson
thanks , bud . 'preciate it .	Bart Simpson
taught stampy any tricks yet , bart ?	Lisa Simpson
nah . he does n't want to learn and i do n't want to teach him . we get along fine .	Bart Simpson
hey , what 's with them ?	Homer Simpson
i think they 're trying to get some attention .	Lisa Simpson
oh . good luck . look at these bills . `` chain for elephant , '' `` shots for elephant '' ... `` oversized decorative poncho '' .	Homer Simpson
technically , it 's for a giraffe , but i think i can let it out a little .	Bart Simpson
well these bills 'll have to be paid out of your allowance .	Homer Simpson
you 'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week .	Bart Simpson
then that 's what i 'll do , smart guy .	Homer Simpson
for the ninth time , no !	Homer Simpson
wait a minute , this gives me an idea .	Homer Simpson
uh , here 's a better sign , dad .	Bart Simpson
i do n't have time to read . just give me the gist of it , son .	Homer Simpson
your kid flew five feet . that counts as a ride . two bucks .	Homer Simpson
yeah well , you 'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels .	Lisa Simpson
you guys do n't understand stampy . he 's just like me . we 're a pair of jokers and both of us are wild . we do n't take nothin ' from nobody .	Bart Simpson
look at this , marge ! fifty-eight dollars ! and all of it profit ! i 'm the smartest businessman in the world !	Homer Simpson
stampy 's food bill today was three hundred dollars .	Marge Simpson
marge , please do n't humiliate me in front of the money .	Homer Simpson
um , milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once . right ?	Homer Simpson
well , that was under our old price structure . under our new price structure , your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars . now , you 've already paid me four dollars , so that 's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me .	Homer Simpson
this town is full of deadbeats . we ca n't afford this elephant .	Homer Simpson
no , dad , he 's my friend !	Bart Simpson
sorry , bart . i 'm gon na have to sell him .	Homer Simpson
what do you mean ? it 's an elephant , is n't it ?	Homer Simpson
he likes peanuts .	Homer Simpson
it 's perfect , dad .	Lisa Simpson
i only have two questions . how much , and give it to me .	Homer Simpson
so , your bid is zero .	Homer Simpson
thank you .	Homer Simpson
thank you .	Homer Simpson
dad , i think he 's an ivory dealer . his boots are ivory , his hat is ivory , and i 'm pretty sure that check is ivory .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low .	Homer Simpson
mr. blackheart ?	Lisa Simpson
are you an ivory dealer ?	Lisa Simpson
dad , you ca n't do this . stampy is my friend .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , son . i 'll get you a new elephant .	Homer Simpson
done .	Homer Simpson
here 's the keys .	Homer Simpson
i 'll just keep these then .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , stampy . i wo n't let homer sell you to that ivory dealer .	Bart Simpson
you and i are gon na run away together . we 'll keep to the back roads , and make our way south . then , if i know my geography , it 's just twelve miles to africa . okay bud , very quietly , let 's just sneak through ...	Bart Simpson
stampy !	Bart Simpson
mom ! dad ! bart and stampy are gone !	Lisa Simpson
oh my lord !	Marge Simpson
i 'll bet it 's because of that horrible ivory dealer , dad .	Lisa Simpson
he took bart too ?	Homer Simpson
that was n't part of our deal , blackheart ! that was n't paaaaart ! !	Homer Simpson
piece of cake . all we have to do is follow the path of destruction .	Homer Simpson
stupid tornado . look . it got patty and selma .	Homer Simpson
elephant , honey . it 's an elephant . and i 'm sure he 'll make a grand piano .	Homer Simpson
stampy ! stampy ! where are you , boy ?	Bart Simpson
he 's gone forever .	Bart Simpson
stampy !	Bart Simpson
ahhh . you 're lonely for other elephants , are n't you ?	Bart Simpson
a deer !	Lisa Simpson
a female deer .	Marge Simpson
son , you 're okay ! and you 've led us to the precious ivory . and of course your lovable pet , who it 's connected to ...	Homer Simpson
dad , i ca n't let you sell him . stampy and i are friends .	Bart Simpson
ow . anyway , i want him to go to that animal refuge .	Bart Simpson
forget it . that elephant cost me thousands of dollars .	Homer Simpson
dad , how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'd like it fine .	Homer Simpson
even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys ?	Bart Simpson
yes , of course i would . who would n't like that ? to be part of the music scene ...	Homer Simpson
dad ! you 're sinking !	Lisa Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
get a rope , bart !	Marge Simpson
nah , that 's okay . i 'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out . first i 'll just reach in and pull my legs out .	Homer Simpson
now i 'll pull my arms out with my face ...	Homer Simpson
dad !	Lisa Simpson
homie !	Marge Simpson
stampy , quick ! pull him out !	Bart Simpson
i 'm alive ! i 'm alive . and i owe it all to this feisty feline .	Homer Simpson
dad , feline means cat .	Lisa Simpson
dad !	Lisa Simpson
oh , i guess it would n't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life . and , the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him .	Homer Simpson
thanks , dad .	Bart Simpson
on the other hand , who 's to say what 's right these days ... what with all our modern ideas ... and products .	Homer Simpson
all right . we 'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge .	Homer Simpson
uh , mom . we 're stuck to dad .	Bart Simpson
this is just what happened at the caramel factory .	Marge Simpson
ow ! my hair !	Lisa Simpson
mmm . caramel .	Homer Simpson
so long stampy . i know you 're gon na like it here .	Bart Simpson
no , stampy . no !	Bart Simpson
ah , thanks , boy .	Bart Simpson
whoa ! whoa , boy !	Bart Simpson
atta boy , stampy . butt 'em once for me !	Bart Simpson
gosh , i thought he 'd be happier in his true habitat .	Marge Simpson
then why is he attacking all those other elephants ?	Marge Simpson
lousy job . nothing exciting ever happens .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! what do i get ?	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
hey , this is n't such a great prize . oh , well , this may be a dirty job , but the big guys at the top work even harder .	Homer Simpson
i propose to you that your heir need not be a boy . in this phallocentric society of ours ...	Lisa Simpson
that 's it , boy . you 're our last hope .	Homer Simpson
i just do n't want to be here , dad . besides , i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on .	Bart Simpson
bart , this is n't the kind of thing i normally would think was a good idea , but you would n't have to live with mr. burns , you 'd just get all of his money someday . this could provide for your entire future .	Marge Simpson
uh , sure .	Marge Simpson
i 've got ta stop fantasizing about lee majors . ah , one more .	Marge Simpson
okay , boy , i wrote down exactly what to say . just read it and you 're a shoo-in .	Homer Simpson
hello , mr ... kurns ? i bad want ... money now . me sick .	Bart Simpson
oooh . he card reads good .	Homer Simpson
so pick , please , me ... mr. burns .	Bart Simpson
it 's kurns , stupid !	Homer Simpson
no it 's not .	Marge Simpson
disregard .	Homer Simpson
ow !	Bart Simpson
the boot kicked bart . it kicked him right in the butt .	Homer Simpson
i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now . is n't there something you 'd like to say ?	Marge Simpson
there sure is . kids , you tried your best and you failed miserably . the lesson is , never try . right in the butt . that was great .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Bart Simpson
woo hoo ! we 're rich ! bart , get over to the mansion and open up all the windows . we want to get the old people smell out before we move in .	Homer Simpson
dad , mr. burns has n't passed away yet .	Lisa Simpson
huh ? oh , right . so i guess you 're in okay shape , huh ? no heart problems or anything ...	Homer Simpson
boo !	Homer Simpson
oh , yeah . so good ...	Homer Simpson
that explains his mysterious trip to holland .	Bart Simpson
are you thinking what i 'm thinking ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , let 's push him down the steps .	Homer Simpson
no . you know , bart , since he is giving you all of his money , maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him .	Marge Simpson
well ...	Bart Simpson
c'mon , honey .	Marge Simpson
all right .	Bart Simpson
how come bart gets to do that and i ca n't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside chef boyardee 's house ?	Homer Simpson
whoa .	Bart Simpson
um , uh , i think i 'd like to go home .	Bart Simpson
anything , huh ? okay ... i want pizza , and i want it delivered by krusty the clown .	Bart Simpson
hey , wait ! how can you be here when your show 's on live ?	Bart Simpson
... and i had the greatest time . mr. burns ' house has everything - a hedge maze , a moat , bleached hardwood floors , and a bottomless pit .	Bart Simpson
it could n't possibly be bottomless .	Lisa Simpson
well , for all intents and purposes .	Bart Simpson
hey mom , bart 's throwing peas .	Lisa Simpson
bart , do n't throw peas at your sister .	Marge Simpson
mr. burns throws peas at smithers .	Bart Simpson
ow ! that was a big one .	Lisa Simpson
homer , say something .	Marge Simpson
okay . lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother 's peas .	Homer Simpson
oh yuck , meatloaf ! my most hated of all loafs .	Bart Simpson
that was the end piece . that 's it ! being abusive to your family is one thing but i will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog . go to your room !	Homer Simpson
no ! this family stinks . mr. burns nurtures my destructive side . i 'm suffocating here .	Bart Simpson
bart , you listen .	Homer Simpson
oh , go eat some flowers .	Bart Simpson
my secret shame .	Homer Simpson
bart , you 're coming home .	Homer Simpson
i want to stay here with mr. burns .	Bart Simpson
or what ? you 'll release the dogs ? or the bees ? or the dogs with bees in their mouths , and when they bark , they shoot bees at you ? well go ahead , do your worst .	Homer Simpson
he locked the door ! i 'll show him .	Homer Simpson
i 'm very concerned . mr. burns has stolen our son and he wo n't give him back .	Marge Simpson
you know we should really stop hiring him .	Marge Simpson
beats me . but it wo n't be back for three hours and forty minutes . once it had snow on it .	Bart Simpson
uh , milhouse , if you stay a little while longer , you can have this blazer . it 's a bob mackie original .	Bart Simpson
for me ? but i do n't know how to drive .	Bart Simpson
that was some ride .	Bart Simpson
are you sure you can get him back for us ?	Marge Simpson
what about peter fonda ?	Marge Simpson
you idiot ! he was the most talented one !	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's hans moleman .	Marge Simpson
can i keep him anyway ? huh , huh ?	Homer Simpson
um , i 'd kind of like to go home now .	Bart Simpson
mr. burns , i do n't want to seem ungrateful . but , i want to go home to my family .	Bart Simpson
it 's probably my imagination but something about them did n't seem quite right .	Bart Simpson
that 's them all right . i ca n't believe it . i guess you 're the only one i can trust ...	Bart Simpson
... dad .	Bart Simpson
lisa , what are you doing ?	Marge Simpson
just trying to fill the void of random , meaningless destruction that bart 's absence has left in our hearts .	Lisa Simpson
that 's sweet , honey .	Marge Simpson
it 's a little tight .	Bart Simpson
excellent .	Bart Simpson
let me try one .	Bart Simpson
hey , the trail of donuts ended . bart !	Homer Simpson
homer !	Bart Simpson
i 'll miss you , son .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , dad ... you 're fired !	Bart Simpson
a little to the left .	Bart Simpson
son , i know you 're upset because you thought you saw us on tv saying we did n't want you in our family . but those were just actors playing us .	Homer Simpson
how do you know ?	Bart Simpson
because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down .	Homer Simpson
yeah , me too . that midget taught me a lot about his native estonia .	Lisa Simpson
the point is the real simpson family missed you a lot and we 're really glad you 're home .	Marge Simpson
i love you guys .	Bart Simpson
right back atcha , son . aw .	Homer Simpson
and now i want you to meet your new brother , hans moleman .	Homer Simpson
give it a try . it 's like kissing a peanut . heh , heh , heh .	Homer Simpson
homer , i want that thing out of my house .	Marge Simpson
they 're gon na eat this up at show and tell .	Bart Simpson
i 'm not sure if i 'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family 's private moments . how would you like it if , twenty years from now , people were laughing at things you did ?	Marge Simpson
not likely . c'mon , have a sense of humor about yourself !	Bart Simpson
argh ! i got ta find something else quick !	Bart Simpson
why do n't you bring this potato ? it 's pretty big .	Marge Simpson
mom , you 're always trying to give me potatoes . what is it with you ?	Bart Simpson
i just think they 're neat .	Marge Simpson
i need something for show and tell .	Bart Simpson
just take one of my geodes . the rocks on my desk .	Lisa Simpson
no , that 's a trilobite ... that 's petrified wood ... bart , that 's a bran	Lisa Simpson
muffin .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll be right back .	Bart Simpson
boys and girls , mrs. krabappel , i come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- what has four legs and ticks ?	Bart Simpson
what ? no , it 's my dog !	Bart Simpson
my dog 's name is santa 's little helper . one time he crawled under the house , and when he came out he was covered with ants . then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water .	Bart Simpson
i thought i 'd be jumping for joy the day skinner left , but now all i have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head .	Bart Simpson
that 's guilt . you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , i guess it is guilt .	Bart Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , let me get this straight . they let everybody out of school early , just because you brought a dog ?	Homer Simpson
well , yeah , but --	Bart Simpson
well , i 'm off to work .	Homer Simpson
the dog has had enough excitement .	Marge Simpson
but marge , dogs can never have enough excitement .	Homer Simpson
look ! ree , ree . ree , ree . aye , aye . all right , all right , i wo n't take the dog . c'mere .	Homer Simpson
how many `` s '' 's in `` innocent '' ?	Homer Simpson
principal skinner ... um , i 'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired , and biting you , and then getting it on with your leg .	Bart Simpson
mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince .	Bart Simpson
um , it 's , it 's a lot of fun .	Bart Simpson
well , it was good to see you .	Bart Simpson
uh , no .	Bart Simpson
uh , i 'm kinda busy on saturday .	Bart Simpson
uh , no i 'll pass . hey , what 's this ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge .	Bart Simpson
uh , i thought i heard someone say your name in the cafeteria , but they might 've been saying `` skim milk . ''	Bart Simpson
yeah , great .	Bart Simpson
do n't you see , milhouse ? we 've gone too far . we need skinner back .	Bart Simpson
table for one .	Bart Simpson
ned , homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school 's being run .	Marge Simpson
wow , i never thought principal skinner could become any more of a square , but there 's the proof .	Lisa Simpson
it 's weird , lis . i miss him as a friend , but i miss him even more as an enemy .	Bart Simpson
i think you need skinner , bart . everybody needs a nemesis . sherlock holmes had his dr. moriarty . mountain dew has its mello-yello . even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow .	Lisa Simpson
if there was some way to get rid of flanders , would you want to come back ?	Bart Simpson
oh , i think i can get him fired . i got you fired , did n't i ?	Bart Simpson
hmm , that 's probably never gon na happen .	Bart Simpson
yeah .	Bart Simpson
well , once he found out we were going to get ned flanders fired , he insisted on helping .	Bart Simpson
that is true .	Homer Simpson
here 's the plan . once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he 'll fire ned on the spot .	Bart Simpson
no problem-o . just make a pass at your commanding officer .	Bart Simpson
what 's going on in there ?	Marge Simpson
c'mon , chalmie . you fired skinner for less than this .	Bart Simpson
so i guess we 're enemies again .	Bart Simpson
sure .	Bart Simpson
how can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like this ?	Bart Simpson
they 're not `` imprisoning us , '' bart . they 're ...	Lisa Simpson
a prison bus , otto ?	Bart Simpson
otto !	Lisa Simpson
ah ! this is what being a kid is all about . hey , huck . what 's l-i-n-c-o-n doin ' here ?	Bart Simpson
hi , abe .	Bart Simpson
ah , the joys of mortgaging your future .	Bart Simpson
my fantasy 's come true .	Bart Simpson
that does it . i 'm outta here .	Bart Simpson
mrs. krabappel , i have to go to the dentist . i have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework .	Bart Simpson
my mom 's number is on there if you want to check up on me .	Bart Simpson
you started off as the bad cop . but now you 're the good one . you and willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago .	Lisa Simpson
now you 're the good cop .	Lisa Simpson
look , if i was under seventeen , i 'd be in school , right ?	Bart Simpson
ca n't let dad see me playing hooky .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't let the boy see me skipping work .	Homer Simpson
good afternoon .	Bart Simpson
how do you do , sir ?	Homer Simpson
sucker .	Homer Simpson
aye carumba !	Bart Simpson
let 's see him track me now .	Bart Simpson
oh , my god , he is like some sort of non ... giving up ... school guy .	Bart Simpson
i 'm one of your nephews you do n't see very often . bart-bart .	Bart Simpson
hey mcbain , i 'm a big fan , but your last movie really sucked .	Bart Simpson
wow ! this is the biggest rice krispy square i 've ever seen . boy , the rich sure know how to live .	Bart Simpson
ah , that 's got ta hoit !	Bart Simpson
it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death . those quimby children are so wild and rich . i hope he finally gets what 's coming to him .	Marge Simpson
but freddy quimby 's innocent .	Bart Simpson
how do you know ? there were n't any witnesses .	Lisa Simpson
oh , yeah . right .	Bart Simpson
you 'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that .	Lisa Simpson
well they did n't , okay ? they did n't ! it says right here in black and white , no witnesses . case closed . now let 's all read the funnies .	Bart Simpson
oh look , charlie brown said `` good grief . '' i did n't see that comin ' .	Bart Simpson
lisa , i got ta tell somebody . i was at the quimby compound yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked . i know that freddy quimby is innocent .	Bart Simpson
you 're a witness ? bart , you have to tell the police .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't .	Bart Simpson
why ?	Lisa Simpson
what he said .	Bart Simpson
oh , i see . if you testify , skinner will know you skipped school . well , if freddy quimby did n't do it , i 'm sure he 'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury .	Lisa Simpson
jury duty . i 'll see that quimby kid hang for this .	Homer Simpson
i knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail .	Lisa Simpson
i know you can read my thoughts , boy . meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow/ meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow .	Homer Simpson
ya see , lisa ? they do n't need my testimony .	Bart Simpson
only because mayor quimby 's buying his nephew 's freedom .	Lisa Simpson
the system works . just ask claus von bulow .	Bart Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
all right .	Homer Simpson
okay , fine .	Homer Simpson
well bart , because of you , a horrible , yet innocent person is going to jail .	Lisa Simpson
maybe i should come forward .	Bart Simpson
what ? uh , um , yeah . uh , i just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench .	Bart Simpson
keep up the good work , toots .	Bart Simpson
chicks on the bench ...	Lisa Simpson
what does sequestered mean ?	Homer Simpson
what does deadlocked mean ?	Homer Simpson
uh-huh . and `` if '' ?	Homer Simpson
so `` if '' we do n't all vote the same way , we 'll be `` deadlocked '' and have to be `` sequestered '' in the springfield palace hotel .	Homer Simpson
where we 'll get ... a free room , free food , free swimming pool , free hbo - oooh , `` free willy ! ''	Homer Simpson
uh , how are the rest of you voting ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm only doing what i think is right . i believe freddie quimby should walk out of here a free hotel .	Homer Simpson
oh , i miss you too , marge . but the law needs me . i 'll be home as soon as i can .	Homer Simpson
room service ? send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em .	Homer Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
so bart , have your insides been gnawed away by guilt , yet ?	Lisa Simpson
sell it to hallmark , sis . you 're lookin ' at cucumber boy . as in `` cool as a . ''	Bart Simpson
jump , free willy , jump ! jump with all your might !	Homer Simpson
i do n't like this new director 's cut .	Homer Simpson
got it , barn ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm not stealing it . hotels expect you to take a few things . it 's a souvenir .	Homer Simpson
souvenir .	Homer Simpson
mom , what if there 's a really bad , crummy guy who 's going to jail , but i know he 's innocent ?	Bart Simpson
well , bart , your uncle arthur used to have a saying , `` shoot 'em all and let god sort 'em out . '' unfortunately , one day he put his theory into practice . it took seventy-five federal marshals to bring him down . now , let 's never speak of him again .	Marge Simpson
mom , mom , mom !	Bart Simpson
hmm ?	Marge Simpson
what if i can get this guy off the hook . sh-should i do it ?	Bart Simpson
honey , you should listen to your heart , and not the voices in your head , like a certain uncle did one grey december morn .	Marge Simpson
well , i was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened ...	Bart Simpson
and that 's what really happened .	Bart Simpson
i sorta skipped school .	Bart Simpson
i guess the two things cancel each other out , huh ?	Bart Simpson
well , marge , it was horrible . everyone was against me in that jury room . but i stood by the courage of my convictions and i prevailed . and that 's why we had chinese food for lunch .	Homer Simpson
good for you , homie . you know , a lot of things happened around here while you were gone .	Marge Simpson
great , marge . i wan na hear all about it .	Homer Simpson
give me those ...	Marge Simpson
and those .	Marge Simpson
and those !	Marge Simpson
maggie , can you point to the monkey ?	Homer Simpson
pfft . what do babies know ?	Homer Simpson
maggie , can you point to the credenza ?	Lisa Simpson
homer , you did n't do a very good job frosting maggie 's birthday cake .	Marge Simpson
what ? it 's not magaggie 's birthday ? oh .	Homer Simpson
hey , hey , hey hey , stop it ! i made a special cake for you to ruin . it 's over there .	Marge Simpson
ooh .	Homer Simpson
everybody get ready ! here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress !	Marge Simpson
uh-oh .	Marge Simpson
should n't we wait for the other babies before we open the presents ?	Bart Simpson
we did n't invite the other babies . maggie does n't seem to get along with the other babies .	Lisa Simpson
maggie , we have a surprise for you .	Marge Simpson
do n't forget to give her smeckler 's powder !	Bart Simpson
hot dogs / armour hot dogs ...	Lisa Simpson
what kinds of kids eat armour hot dogs ?	Lisa Simpson
fat kids ...	Bart Simpson
skinny kids ...	Lisa Simpson
kids who climb on rocks ...	Bart Simpson
tough kids ...	Lisa Simpson
sissy kids ...	Bart Simpson
does n't this family know any songs that are n't commercials ?	Lisa Simpson
or , if not then , christmas .	Homer Simpson
homey , you know , it 's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely .	Marge Simpson
hee , hee , hee , hee . that is funny .	Homer Simpson
yeah . anyway , maybe they could go to a matinee together , or shopping , or to that room in the library that 's always full of old people . `` periodicals , '' that 's it .	Marge Simpson
marge , please . old people do n't need companionship . they need to be isolated and studied , so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use .	Homer Simpson
homer , would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet ? !	Marge Simpson
oh .	Homer Simpson
say ! i 've got a neat idea . why do n't you go in and pick up my mother , and we 'll all go out to dinner .	Marge Simpson
that 's not my mother .	Marge Simpson
you know , mom , you and abe have a lot in common . umm , you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam .	Marge Simpson
ooh .	Bart Simpson
pardon me , sir . forgive my clumsiness .	Bart Simpson
not at all .	Homer Simpson
ah , yes , my name is homer simpson , and i 'd like to order an itchy an scratchy cel . my credit card ? ah , do you accept the federal breast inspector 's card ? license to ogle ? viza ? ... oh yes , of course , that 's what i meant , visa . it 's these new dentures .	Bart Simpson
well , i think it 's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother .	Marge Simpson
well , i 'm opposed to the whole thing ! damn opposed !	Homer Simpson
he 's damn opposed ! damn ! damn ! damn opposed !	Bart Simpson
bart ! homer , what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love ?	Marge Simpson
if he marries your mother , marge , we 'll be brother and sister ! and then our kids , they 'll be horrible freaks with pink skin , no overbites , and five fingers on each hand !	Homer Simpson
hello , mom ? fine . you know , abe had a very nice time with you last sunday ...	Marge Simpson
grampa , sssh ! i know my mother . if you come on too strong , she 's going to get scared away .	Marge Simpson
uh ... i love ya , mom !	Marge Simpson

i love ya ! i love ya ! i love ya ! i love ya , mom ! got ta go !	Marge Simpson
that 's me .	Bart Simpson
um ... that 's me .	Bart Simpson

thanks .	Bart Simpson
hey , lis , guess who 's got a genuine itchy and scratchy animation cel ? !	Bart Simpson
it looks like part of scratchy 's arm .	Lisa Simpson
oh , no . i used dad 's credit card to buy this ?	Bart Simpson
yeesh . how much was it ?	Lisa Simpson
three hundred fifty dollars .	Bart Simpson
oooh .	Lisa Simpson
dad , that will never work . if you want to make your move , you 've got ta play it ... cool .	Homer Simpson
now , what you got ta do / if you want to get a kiss / is act real smooth / and make your move like this .	Homer Simpson
now what 's that rule ?	Homer Simpson
is this cel worth anything ?	Bart Simpson
ca n't you give me anything for it ?	Bart Simpson
all right !	Homer Simpson
mom 's almost ready for her date . she sure seems taken by this new beau . i feel so bad for grampa .	Marge Simpson
dad says this new guy is a repulsive , obnoxious old billionaire , so let 's all be extra-nice to him .	Homer Simpson
yabba-dabba-doo !	Homer Simpson
he 's an awful , awful , awful man , but i guess if he makes mom happy , that 's all that really matters .	Marge Simpson
that 's right , money . your money 's happiness is all that moneys .	Homer Simpson
hi . you know , gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me . she especially likes it when they give me money .	Bart Simpson
very well , you leave me no choice .	Bart Simpson
this gun is filled with ketchup . this one with mustard . now give me three hundred fifty bucks or you 're gon na be a mess for your date .	Bart Simpson
dad , i 'm really sorry , but i charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card .	Bart Simpson
what ? !	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , here 's the cash .	Bart Simpson
woo hoo ! three hundred fifty dollars ! ! now i can buy seventy transcripts of `` nightline '' !	Homer Simpson
but dad ...	Bart Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
oh well , he 's happy . i 'm gon na keep this mary worth phone right here . her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again .	Bart Simpson
sure !	Bart Simpson
mom , you ca n't marry mr. burns ! he 's an evil man !	Marge Simpson
ew yuuuuck !	Homer Simpson
what about abe simpson ? do n't you have any feelings for him ?	Marge Simpson
we 're all aware of grampa 's problems , but compared to mr. burns , he 's judge freaking reinhold !	Marge Simpson
hey , barney , why do n't you fill out the groom 's side .	Homer Simpson
where 's grampa ? was n't he invited ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , but his reply envelope just had a check to the gas company in it .	Bart Simpson
hm ? hm ?	Marge Simpson
whew . do n't try to eat these so-called `` chips . ''	Homer Simpson
huh ? oh . okay . i 'll take three .	Homer Simpson
i mean , woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
i was bluffing .	Homer Simpson
how dare you call me that ? !	Homer Simpson
so , anyhoo , last night , we 're playing poker , right . as usual , i 'm winning and not realizing it . and lenny says that i 'm uh ... get this ... `` a little slow . ''	Homer Simpson
how come you 're not laughing ? do you think i 'm slow ?	Homer Simpson
buh .	Bart Simpson
sneh .	Lisa Simpson
we do n't think you 're slow . but , on the other hand , it 's not like you go to museums or read books or anything .	Marge Simpson
you think i do n't want to ? it 's those tv networks , marge . they wo n't let me . one quality show after another . each one fresher and more brilliant than the last . if they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves . but they wo n't , they wo n't let me live !	Homer Simpson
oh , who am i kidding ? i am slow ...	Homer Simpson
oh homie , if you feel so bad about yourself , there 's always things you can do to feel better .	Marge Simpson
take another bath in malt liquor ?	Homer Simpson
... there 's that . or , you could take an adult education course .	Marge Simpson
oh , and how is `` education '' supposed to make me feel smarter ? besides , every time i learn something new , it pushes some old stuff out of my brain . remember when i took that home wine making course and i forgot how to drive ?	Homer Simpson
that 's because you were drunk !	Marge Simpson
and how .	Homer Simpson
wait a minute , even lenny is teaching a class . look at the way they admire and adore him .	Homer Simpson
that 's it ! if he can teach a class , he can teach a class . i mean , i can teach a class .	Homer Simpson
well ... i can tell the difference between butter and `` i ca n't believe it 's not butter . ''	Homer Simpson
i 've failed again . everybody can teach a class but me . i 'm an idiot . what am i gon na tell my wife and kids ?	Homer Simpson
that depends . is there another way to get this job ?	Homer Simpson
look , everyone ! now that i 'm a teacher , i 've sewed patches on my elbows .	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer , not the other way around . you 've ruined a perfectly good jacket .	Marge Simpson
incorrect , marge . two perfectly good jackets .	Homer Simpson
i think it 's great you 're a teacher , dad . so , will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation ?	Lisa Simpson
yes , lisa . daddy 's a teacher .	Homer Simpson
ca n't talk now , flanders . i 've got a class to teach .	Homer Simpson
nothing for me , today ! i 've got a class to teach !	Homer Simpson
it 's all right ! i 'm a teacher .	Homer Simpson
all right , the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class .	Homer Simpson
down the hall , room twelve .	Homer Simpson
ew . okay , let 's get started .	Homer Simpson
no talking .	Homer Simpson
yeah , yeah . that 'll eat up some time . uh , how 'bout you , otto .	Homer Simpson
huh ? yeah , i was listening . very funny .	Homer Simpson
uh , yes , yes . to the untrained eye i 'm eating an orange . but to the eye that has brains , i am making a point about marriage . for you see , marriage is a lot like an orange .	Homer Simpson
first you have the skin , then the sweet , sweet innards .	Homer Simpson
okay . but then we 've got to get to work .	Homer Simpson
i told marge this would n't work the other night in bed .	Homer Simpson
no , that 's not what i meant . marge and i always talk things over in bed . like the other night we were fighting about money .	Homer Simpson
i was telling marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah . she 's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen .	Homer Simpson
i went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word . i really think i was born to teach .	Homer Simpson
whatever do you mean ? i do n't dye my hair ...	Marge Simpson
i do n't know what you 're talking about .	Marge Simpson
that 's nice .	Marge Simpson
come on , marge . let me in ! there 's crickets out here .	Homer Simpson
homer , i really do n't like you telling personal secrets in your class .	Marge Simpson
marge , i did n't tell 'em personal stuff .	Homer Simpson
today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair .	Marge Simpson
oh , you mean about you . all right , maybe i said some things -- some personal things . but , you should have seen 'em , marge . they really wanted to hear what i had to say .	Homer Simpson
mm-hmm . i 'm happy about that . but , i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy .	Marge Simpson
look , marge , you do n't know what it 's like . i 'm the one there everyday , putting his ass on the line . and i 'm not out of order . you 're out of order . the whole freakin ' system is out of order . you want the truth ? you want the truth ? you ca n't handle the truth . 'cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend 's face , you 'll know what to do . forget it , marge - it 's chinatown .	Homer Simpson
homer , do n't ever tell them personal stuff about me again .	Marge Simpson
yes ma'am .	Homer Simpson
now what is a wedding ? well , webster 's dictionary describes a wedding as : 'the process of removing weeds from one 's garden . '	Homer Simpson
this is a place of learning , not a house of ... hearing about things .	Homer Simpson
no , wait ! uh , uh , wait ! ... i , yes ! i do have a story about two other young marrieds .	Homer Simpson
now , the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom . it seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow .	Homer Simpson
well let 's just call 'em uh , `` mr. x '' and `` mrs . y . '' so anyway , mr. x would say , 'marge , if this does n't get your motor running , my name is n't homer j . simpson . '	Homer Simpson
homer , do n't you have to get to class ?	Marge Simpson
not tonight , marge . tonight we can eat a nice , leisurely dinner at home .	Homer Simpson
oh , well that will be ...	Marge Simpson
what the darn ... ?	Marge Simpson
marge , you 'll never guess what . my whole class is here . they 're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives .	Homer Simpson
so , little lisa , apple of my eye . how are things down at the ol ' schoolhouse ?	Homer Simpson
i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares .	Lisa Simpson
and how 's my little major leaguer ? catch any junebugs today ?	Homer Simpson
well , me and milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer .	Bart Simpson
son , i know you meant well , but that was n't the right thing to do .	Homer Simpson
what the hell are you talkin ' about ? you 're the one who double dared us .	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
i 'm outta here !	Bart Simpson
me too .	Lisa Simpson
well , now that the little ones have toddled off to bed ...	Homer Simpson
i want this to end now !	Marge Simpson
all right . okay . everybody out !	Marge Simpson
get out ! get out ! get out !	Marge Simpson
all right , we 're breaking early tonight , class . for tomorrow , you should read pages seven through eighteen in lisa 's diary .	Homer Simpson
you , too .	Marge Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
get out !	Marge Simpson
but i 'm not in the cla ...	Homer Simpson
okay , marge , things were said , mistakes were made . let 's end this madness and get on with our lives .	Homer Simpson
you just do n't get it , do you , homer ? you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you would n't . i ca n't trust you anymore .	Marge Simpson
but , i learned my lesson . it 'll never happen again .	Homer Simpson
aw , marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing .	Homer Simpson
honey , the door blew shut ! oh . fine . that 's what you want ? you got it . this scene is gettin ' old , man . i 'm hittin ' the road . maybe i 'll drop you a line someday from wherever i wind up in this crazy old world .	Homer Simpson
kids , your father and i are going through a really tough time right now . and i do n't know what 's going to happen , but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much .	Marge Simpson
wow , i 've never seen mom so mad at homer before .	Bart Simpson
i 'll tell you a secret , bart . every time i 'm worried about mom and dad , i go to the attic and add to my ball of string .	Lisa Simpson
earth base , this is commander bart mccool . we are under attack by the zorrinid brain changers ! quickly , into the safety dome , milbot !	Bart Simpson
do n't mind me boys , just scrubbing my undies .	Homer Simpson
keep up the rough-housing , son . without a strong male presence in the house , you could turn sissy overnight . oh , these stubborn grass stains .	Homer Simpson
oh , good , reverend lovejoy will make marge take me back . he has to push the sanctity of marriage or his god will punish him .	Homer Simpson
but , is n't that a sin ?	Marge Simpson
good night , marge .	Homer Simpson
why did n't i take a picture ? i had ten years to take a picture .	Homer Simpson
funny ... the way everything reminds me of homer .	Marge Simpson
i love you ... will you marry me , marge ? ... you mean i 'm gon na be a daddy ? ... i hope we 'll always be together ... together ... together ...	Homer Simpson
together ?	Homer Simpson
here , dad . i brought you some nice ...	Lisa Simpson
good news , lisa . i do n't need your mother anymore . i 've created a replacement that 's superior to her in almost every way .	Homer Simpson
dad , that 's just a plant .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , you will respect your new mother . now give her a kiss . kisss herrr .	Homer Simpson
ohmygodohmygodohmygod . all right , let 's get our stories straight . she tripped , right ?	Homer Simpson
look , i brought you some nice pudding .	Lisa Simpson
ah , your flesh mother used to bring me pudding . oh , i miss marge . lisa you 're smart . help me trick her into taking me back .	Homer Simpson
dad , you ca n't trick somebody into loving you . there 's a reason two people come together and stay together . there 's something they give each other that nobody else can give them . if you want to get mom back , you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me .	Homer Simpson
no .	Lisa Simpson
okay , thirty .	Homer Simpson
good luck , dad .	Lisa Simpson
all right , brain . it 's all up to you . if you do n't think of what it is , we 'll lose marge forever .	Homer Simpson
oh my . i 'm very flattered , but i 'm not really interested .	Marge Simpson
why do n't you come inside for a drink of water ?	Marge Simpson
moe , what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
here 's your water , moe .	Marge Simpson
bye , moe !	Homer Simpson
homer , what happened to you ?	Marge Simpson
marge , i figured out what i can give you that no one else can .	Homer Simpson
a bouquet of po ...	Homer Simpson
i give up . i do n't deserve to live with you .	Homer Simpson
my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table .	Homer Simpson
oh , here , let me help you .	Marge Simpson
wait a minute ! wait , that 's it ! i know now what i can offer you that no one else can . complete and utter dependence .	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's not a good thing .	Marge Simpson
are you kidding ? it 's a wondrous , marvelous thing . marge , i need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you . i need you to take care of me , to put up with me , and most of all , i need you to love me , because i love you .	Homer Simpson
but , how do i know i can trust you ?	Marge Simpson
marge , look at me ! we 've been separated for a day , and i 'm as dirty as a frenchman . in another few hours , i 'll be dead . i ca n't afford to lose your trust again .	Homer Simpson
i must admit , you really do make a gal feel needed .	Marge Simpson
it 's great to be indoors with my family .	Homer Simpson
i 'm really glad you 're back , dad . i knew you could do it . now do n't screw it up .	Lisa Simpson
look , dad . i missed you so much , i could n't concentrate in school and i got an `` f '' .	Bart Simpson
hey , this is dated two weeks ago .	Homer Simpson
oh , sorry . here 's a fresh one .	Bart Simpson
and i have a special present for you , but i 'll give it to you later tonight .	Marge Simpson
special present ? ! i do n't wan na wait ! i want it now ! i want the children to see . oh . right . later .	Homer Simpson
hey , moe !	Homer Simpson
homer , my hat goes off to you .	Bart Simpson
it 's cool in here , boy . for the rest of the summer , we can live inside the refrigerator .	Homer Simpson
homer , the fridge was n't meant to be used this way . although i must say , it 's certainly refreshing .	Marge Simpson
i got the idea when i noticed the refrigerator was cold .	Homer Simpson
wo n't this overload the motor ?	Marge Simpson
marge , can you set the oven to cold ?	Homer Simpson
ah , face it , bart . our salvation is n't just gon na roll by on the back of some stupid truck .	Lisa Simpson
pool mobile ? ! !	Lisa Simpson
look , lis , i snatched five bathing suits . all martin 's !	Bart Simpson
time 's up ? !	Lisa Simpson
so long , lis . i 'm gon na stow away underwater , and go where the pool goes . have a good life .	Bart Simpson
oh well . same time tomorrow , otto ?	Bart Simpson
dad ...	Lisa Simpson

dad ...	Lisa Simpson
yes , lisa ?	Homer Simpson
dad , as you know , we 've been swimming . and we 've developed a taste for it . we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go . now before you respond , you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of ...	Lisa Simpson
canwehaveapooldad ? canwehaveapooldad ? canwehaveapooldad ? canwehaveapooldad ? canwehaveapooldad ? canwe ... etc .	Lisa Simpson
i understand . let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk .	Homer Simpson
ooh , the tinkler . i like the sound of that . we 'll take it .	Homer Simpson
is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in ?	Marge Simpson
all right , everybody in the pool !	Homer Simpson
is it a pool yet ?	Homer Simpson
yes , dad .	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
who could that be ... ?	Marge Simpson

hey , guys ! sign my cast ? sign my cast ? guys ... ?	Bart Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
faithful milhouse . you 'll spend the long , hot days by my side , wo n't you ?	Bart Simpson
but you 're wearing your glasses .	Bart Simpson
oh , look . bart 's all alone . maybe i should keep him company , at least for a little while .	Lisa Simpson
aw , great . i get to spend the summer with my brain .	Bart Simpson
what fun can you have in a pool , anyway , that you ca n't have in a bathtub with a garbage bag taped around your cast ?	Bart Simpson
traitors . go on and have your pool . i 'm fine by myself , right here .	Bart Simpson
you know , this is n't so bad . i 'll just spend the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called television .	Bart Simpson
wow . the universe is so boring .	Bart Simpson
ah ... there 's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet , peaceful dip in your very own pool .	Homer Simpson
yaaarr -- ewwwwwww ! !	Homer Simpson
lisa ! the blob has got me ! do n't touch me , or he 'll get you too !	Homer Simpson
dad ... you have to put chlorine in the water every day , to keep it clean .	Lisa Simpson
chlorine , eh ?	Homer Simpson
hmm , maybe we should spend more time with bart . he 's becoming isolated and weird .	Marge Simpson
i swear i do n't know where the bombs are ! only the miners know that ! maybe this will loosen your tongue ! no ! blah ! !	Bart Simpson
uh , bart ... ?	Lisa Simpson
do n't turn on that light ! !	Bart Simpson
sorry . i just came to see how you were feeling .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm fine . just fine .	Bart Simpson

uh , no .	Bart Simpson
yuh huh . `` cast of characters : viceroy fizzlebottom , a hearty cherub of a man ... ''	Lisa Simpson

oh , well , y'know , it ai n't so great . bart , it 's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life ! well , anyway , i brought you a present .	Lisa Simpson
look , it 's the telescope i won at the optics festival .	Lisa Simpson
there was an optics festival and i was n't informed ? you go now .	Bart Simpson
but ...	Lisa Simpson

what have we here ... `` the lighter side of hippies '' . they do n't care whose toes they step on . .	Bart Simpson
this was a lovely idea , homie . come here and kiss me .	Marge Simpson
mmmm ... .	Homer Simpson
i know , i 'll use this to peer into springfield 's seamy underbelly .	Bart Simpson
i 'm never ever gon na see anything interesting with this stupid piece of junk .	Bart Simpson
that came from flanders ' house .	Bart Simpson
ca n't be what it looks like . this is flanders we 're talkin ' about .	Bart Simpson
ah , i 'll just watch some tv .	Bart Simpson
uh , uh , noo . this ca n't be what it looks like . there 's got ta be some other explanation .	Bart Simpson
then that 's not the real ned flanders .	Bart Simpson
if that 's not flanders , he 's done his homework !	Bart Simpson
he 's gon na kill rod and todd , too ... that 's horrible . in principle .	Bart Simpson
thanks , nelson .	Lisa Simpson
shut up , brain ! i got friends now . i do n't need you anymore . duh , yeah , i 'd love to go to your house .	Lisa Simpson
hello ? hey , i 'm stuck in here . i got ta think of a way to get out .	Lisa Simpson
listen , ned flanders murdered his wife .	Bart Simpson
but why ? she 's such a fox . i mean , what 's on fox tonight ? something ribald , no doubt .	Homer Simpson
i wish you 'd stop spreading bad rumors about people . remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered ?	Marge Simpson
sure . that was twenty minutes ago .	Bart Simpson
bart , i 'm really sorry i 've been ignoring you lately . i got carried away with being popular . but now that i 'm unpopular again , i want you to know i 'm here for you .	Lisa Simpson
you can start makin ' it up to me right now . flanders is leaving the house . i want you to sneak in there and bring me back some evidence ... and something sweet for later .	Bart Simpson
bart , i 'm here for you but , i 'm not gon na break into somebody 's house .	Lisa Simpson
all right . you 're right , you 're right . let's-let 's just forget about that . let me read to you from my play . `` kippers for breakfast , aunt helga ? is it st. swivens day already ? '' `` 't is , '' replied aunt helga .	Bart Simpson
i 'm goin ' , i 'm goin !	Lisa Simpson
a human head !	Bart Simpson
of course . oh no . he 's back . flanders is back ! lisa , get outta there !	Bart Simpson
no , lisa , do n't go upstairs . you 'll be trapped !	Bart Simpson
an axe ! he 's got an axe . i 'll save you , lisa !	Bart Simpson
uh ... i 'll save you by calling the police .	Bart Simpson
you see , marge ? you see ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll save you , cast or no cast !	Bart Simpson
got ta save lisa , trash can or no trash can !	Bart Simpson
oh !	Lisa Simpson
nooooo !	Bart Simpson
i came to stop you from murdering lisa like you murdered your wife .	Bart Simpson
but i distinctly heard you say that maude was with god .	Bart Simpson
but i saw the murder , and then i saw you bury the corpse in the backyard .	Bart Simpson
but i heard a woman scream .	Bart Simpson
oh , well i guess that explains everything .	Bart Simpson
not everything . there 's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife .	Homer Simpson
oh , i see . then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package . really , i mean that . sorry if it sounded sarcastic .	Homer Simpson
lisa , will you keep it down ! ? i 'm making a crank phone call to principal skinner .	Bart Simpson
it 's my room and i can do what i want .	Lisa Simpson
oh , yeah ? well , i can do what i want in my room .	Bart Simpson
bart , quit it !	Lisa Simpson
i can keep this up all day .	Bart Simpson
lisa , stop the racket . i 'm trying to fix your mother 's camera . now easy ... easy .	Homer Simpson
hm , i 'm gon na need a bigger drill .	Homer Simpson
my , these seas are certainly heaving .	Marge Simpson
lisa , stop blowing my sex ! i mean , stop blowing your sax . your sax . stop it .	Marge Simpson
mom , i 'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i 've got to practice !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry , but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time .	Marge Simpson
fine . i 'll play outside .	Lisa Simpson
sorry , ralph . that would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation .	Lisa Simpson
ooh ! ooh !	Lisa Simpson
i never made miss hoover yow-wee .	Lisa Simpson
hi , allison ? i 'm lisa simpson . oh , it 's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level .	Lisa Simpson
you 're younger than me , too ?	Lisa Simpson
no . i just like to smell my lunch ... gee , i never met anyone who skipped a grade before .	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm sure i could have , but i 'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends .	Lisa Simpson
the sax .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm going for first chair this year .	Lisa Simpson
wow , with so much in common , i 'm sure we 'll be the best of friends .	Lisa Simpson
me , too .	Lisa Simpson
hurry up and finish eating !	Bart Simpson
you 're steerin ' fine , boy ... hard to the right !	Homer Simpson
oh !	Bart Simpson
hard to the left !	Homer Simpson
whoa !	Bart Simpson
cat ! ... deer ! ... old man !	Homer Simpson
jackknifed sugar truck . sugar ?	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , buddy . here 's a quarter . call for help at the nearest phone ... i 'll keep an eye on things here .	Homer Simpson
homer , that was downright decent of you .	Bart Simpson
we hit the jackpot , here ! white gold ! texas tea ... sweetener .	Homer Simpson
dad , is n't this stealing ?	Bart Simpson
read your town charter , boy . `` if food stuffs should touch the ground , said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot . '' since i do n't see him around , start shoveling .	Homer Simpson
mom .	Lisa Simpson
what ! what ?	Marge Simpson
why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know , honey . i guess that 's the school 's decision to make .	Marge Simpson
well , did you ever talk to anyone at the school ? make a few calls on my behalf ? maybe you could 've been `` nicer '' to principal skinner , if you know what i mean .	Lisa Simpson
lisa ! i am nice .	Marge Simpson
homer , i really appreciate you making dinner , but this food tastes a little strange .	Marge Simpson
it hurts my teeth .	Lisa Simpson
that 's because i 've loaded it with sugar ! ! ... marge , our ship has come in ! i found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that i 'm gon na sell directly to the consumer . and all for a low , low price of one dollar per pound .	Homer Simpson
but the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound .	Marge Simpson
and it does n't have nails and broken glass in it ...	Lisa Simpson
those are prizes . ooo , a blasting cap !	Homer Simpson
i won first chair ?	Lisa Simpson
what 's happening ... oh ... it was just a dream .	Lisa Simpson
i won first chair ?	Lisa Simpson
i need help , mom . there 's another girl at school who 's smarter , younger , and a better sax player than me . oh i feel so average .	Lisa Simpson
well , you 'll always be number one to me ...	Marge Simpson
hell-o . first born within earshot .	Bart Simpson
uh ... i meant , my number one girl .	Marge Simpson
oh , for chri ...	Marge Simpson
honey , if you get too competitive you 'll never be happy . no matter how good you are there 's always gon na be someone better than you . i always thought i had the tallest hair . but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes .	Marge Simpson
but she 's better than me at everything that makes me special .	Lisa Simpson
believe me , honey . she 's more scared of you than you are of her .	Marge Simpson
you 're thinking of bears , mom .	Lisa Simpson
sugar man ! !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't tell you either , ralph .	Lisa Simpson
ah , that used to be my face in the mud ...	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't stand to see you so miserable , lis , unless it 's from a rubber spider down your dress . hmmm . that gives me an idea .	Bart Simpson
note for later . put rubber spider down lisa 's dress .	Bart Simpson
hey , i know ... how about if i dig up some dirt on allison ? remember how i got milhouse 's picture on america 's most wanted ?	Bart Simpson
i appreciate the offer , but it goes against every moral fiber in my body .	Lisa Simpson
suit yourself . but if you change your mind , here 's my card .	Bart Simpson
i do n't need a card . you live in the room next to me .	Lisa Simpson
note : next year order fewer cards .	Bart Simpson
and you did n't think i 'd make any money . i found a dollar while i was waiting for the bus .	Homer Simpson
while you were out `` earning '' that dollar , you lost forty dollars by not going to work . the plant called and said if you do n't come in tomorrow , do n't bother coming in monday .	Marge Simpson
woo hoo ! a four day weekend !	Homer Simpson
hey , i am above average ! so what if allison 's ahead of me ? there 's no shame in being second .	Lisa Simpson
why would they come to our concert just to boo us ?	Lisa Simpson
lis , i did some checkin ' on this allison character and i know it 's against all your moral fibers ...	Bart Simpson
yep , she 's clean as a bean . but , i did tip off the feds as to the whereabouts of our good friend , milhouse .	Bart Simpson
i 've got to stop being so petty . i should be allison 's friend , not her competitor . i mean , she is a wonderful person .	Lisa Simpson
way to go , lis . i mean , why compete with someone who 's just gon na kick your butt anyway ?	Bart Simpson
i prefer my phrasing .	Lisa Simpson
you 're a wonderful person .	Lisa Simpson
oh really ? i ...	Lisa Simpson
jeremy 's iron .	Lisa Simpson
what 's this ?	Lisa Simpson
you 're finished already ? but the competition is n't for weeks .	Lisa Simpson
it 's great . it 's really great .	Lisa Simpson
must ... protect ... sugar ... thieves everywhere ... the strong must protect the sweet ... the sweet	Homer Simpson
homer ?	Marge Simpson
in america , first you get the sugar , then you get the power , then you get the women .	Homer Simpson
homer , homer !	Marge Simpson
huh , wha ?	Homer Simpson
i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar . you 're being completely paranoid .	Marge Simpson
oh am i , am i really ?	Homer Simpson
a-ha !	Homer Simpson
all right , pal . where 'd you get the sugar for that tea ?	Homer Simpson
homer , when are you gon na give up this crazy sugar scheme ?	Marge Simpson
never ! never , marge ! i ca n't live the buttoned-down life like you . i want it all : the terrifying lows , the dizzying highs , the creamy middles . sure i might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors . oh , i 'll never be the darling of the so called `` city fathers '' who cluck their tongues , stroke their beards , and talk about what 's to be done with this homer simpson .	Homer Simpson
look , just get rid of the sugar , okay ?	Marge Simpson
no !	Homer Simpson
hey ! get off my sugar ! bad bees ! bad !	Homer Simpson
ow ! ow ! oh , they 're defending themselves somehow !	Homer Simpson
look , bart . it almost killed me , but i hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from oliver twist . and now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm .	Lisa Simpson
uh oh !	Bart Simpson
is it okay ? !	Lisa Simpson
well , the important thing is that we survived .	Bart Simpson
oh who am i kidding ? there 's no way i 'm ever gon na beat allison !	Lisa Simpson
well sure there is ... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded , a bit devious , a bit , as the french say , `` bartesque . ''	Bart Simpson
i 'll do whatever it takes .	Lisa Simpson
then welcome to the nether regions of the soul . now here 's what we do . tomorrow morning when allison comes out of her house , we spray her with the hose , soaking her from head to toe , leaving us relatively dry .	Bart Simpson
relatively ?	Lisa Simpson
well , there 's bound to be some splashback .	Bart Simpson
bart , her being wet wo n't help me win the competition .	Lisa Simpson
well , we could just sabotage her diorama , humiliating her in front of the students and faculty .	Bart Simpson
perfect !	Lisa Simpson
leaving her primed for the most traumatic hose-soaking of her life .	Bart Simpson
enough with the hose !	Lisa Simpson
bees are on the what , now ?	Homer Simpson
deal !	Homer Simpson
nooooooo ! my sugar is melting ! melting ! oh what a world !	Homer Simpson
oh sugar !	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , homie .	Marge Simpson
it 's okay , marge . i 've learned my lesson . a mountain of sugar is too much for one man . it 's clear now why god portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in hawaii .	Homer Simpson
lisa , here is as the french say , `` le fake diorama . '' i 'll create a diversion and you make the switch .	Bart Simpson
hey , everybody , whoa , look at me . i 'm over here . turn this way right now .	Bart Simpson
it 's a cow 's heart . they 're trying to make a monkey outta you !	Bart Simpson
right on !	Bart Simpson
it 's the beating of that hideous heart ! i mean , i think i hear something .	Lisa Simpson
why , here 's allison 's real diorama . it got misplaced , ... or so it would seem .	Lisa Simpson
you 're a shoo-in now , lis .	Bart Simpson
after the way i 've behaved , i do n't deserve to win .	Lisa Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
like what ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm really sorry about what i did , allison . it 's no shame being second to you .	Lisa Simpson
only if we 're the best .	Lisa Simpson
hey , ralph . want to come with me and allison to play anagrams ?	Lisa Simpson
this romance is so full of heartfelt passion . i can really identify with this corn-fed heroine . homer . are you awake ? this is important , give me some sign you 're awake .	Marge Simpson
wake up !	Marge Simpson
huh ? wuzz wrong ? house run away ? dog 's on fire ?	Homer Simpson
homie , do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives ?	Marge Simpson
wake up !	Marge Simpson
marge , it 's three a.m. and i worked all day !	Homer Simpson
it 's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie 's kiddy pool .	Marge Simpson
there you are . thought you could get away , huh ?	Homer Simpson
i can hit that one pin all right . but the rest of them do n't even wobble .	Marge Simpson
you mean `` shining . ''	Bart Simpson
homer , young people learn about love from adults , and we 've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general . i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book .	Marge Simpson
hmmm .	Homer Simpson
i knew i should n't have put a fireplace in the bedroom .	Marge Simpson
how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon ?	Marge Simpson
it 's a new episode .	Bart Simpson
not exactly . they pieced it together from old shows , and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth .	Lisa Simpson
really ?	Bart Simpson
ren and stimpy do it all the time .	Lisa Simpson
yes , they do , and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy ? children , your father and i have fed you and clothed you , but we 've neglected something more important . it 's time to learn about love .	Marge Simpson
no need , mom . we already learned in school .	Bart Simpson
bo-ring .	Bart Simpson
i mean romance not love .	Marge Simpson
mom , romance is dead . it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney . homogenized , then sold off piece by piece .	Lisa Simpson
that 's not true . romance is all around us . in our neighborhoods ...	Marge Simpson
even on our jobs ...	Marge Simpson
all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories .	Marge Simpson
hmmm .	Bart Simpson
hello , is al there ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , al . last name caholic .	Bart Simpson
no , no , no . no , ask your heart what its fondest desire is .	Marge Simpson
hm ...	Homer Simpson
mmmm , chocolate ... / mmmm , invisible cola . / mmmm , forbidden donut . / mmmm sacrilicious . mmmm , / mmmm , free goo . mmmm , something .	Homer Simpson
no , think about people . about moments in your life that have been very romantic .	Marge Simpson
oh , okay .	Homer Simpson
that 's not the idea at all . okay , well this story is n't ideal , i 've never told it to you before .	Marge Simpson
i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless .	Marge Simpson
so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him , or her ...	Marge Simpson
oh !	Marge Simpson
i 'm awfully sorry .	Marge Simpson
oh , no , no . homer is my ... ball 's name . i 'm marge .	Marge Simpson
no ... no , thank you , mr ... uh ... ... brunswick .	Marge Simpson
jacques .	Marge Simpson
hmmm .	Marge Simpson
sure .	Marge Simpson
never .	Marge Simpson
no .	Marge Simpson
oh , i do n't want to trouble you .	Marge Simpson
all right . but i 'm not very good .	Marge Simpson
oh !	Marge Simpson
but ...	Marge Simpson
you 're a very good teacher !	Marge Simpson
you did n't have to drop me off .	Marge Simpson
oh , jacques , i 'm a married woman .	Marge Simpson
what 's brunch ?	Marge Simpson
you did n't have to drop me off .	Marge Simpson
he seemed to know a lot about brunch . but it turned out he was n't interested in brunch at all .	Marge Simpson
that does n't shock me .	Marge Simpson
is thursday okay ?	Marge Simpson
thank goodness i drove down an ironic street .	Marge Simpson
i made the right decision to stay with my homie , and there was no harm done . so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband , that 's my idea of romance .	Marge Simpson
happy valentine 's .	Lisa Simpson
marge , i want you to stop seeing this jacque . you can let him down gently . but over the next couple of months , i want you to break it off .	Homer Simpson
okay , homer .	Marge Simpson
ooh , that was a close one , kids .	Homer Simpson
okay , marge . as long as we 're traumatizing the kids , i have a scandalous story of my own .	Homer Simpson
hi .	Homer Simpson
got ta go .	Homer Simpson
i made it the whole day without seeing her again .	Homer Simpson
i mean hello !	Homer Simpson
that 's okay . i 'll just push the button for the stimulator , i mean elevator .	Homer Simpson
that 's unsexy .	Homer Simpson
ew .	Homer Simpson
well , this is my floor .	Homer Simpson
see you tomorrow ... .	Homer Simpson
i tried to avoid her , but we were sent to a nuclear convention in capital city together ...	Homer Simpson
stop that . i love my wife and family . all i 'm gon na use this bed for is sleeping , eating , and maybe building a little fort . that 's it .	Homer Simpson
oh , mindy , we have to fight our temptation .	Homer Simpson
oh !	Homer Simpson
go to hell !	Homer Simpson
i was doing my best to resist her ...	Homer Simpson
but at dinner , the fortune cookie predicted doom .	Homer Simpson
yeah , yeah .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah . like you do n't know . we 're gon na have sex .	Homer Simpson
yes we do . the cookie told me so .	Homer Simpson
but they 're so sweet .	Homer Simpson
oh , baby .	Homer Simpson
this was a wonderful idea , homie .	Marge Simpson
what happened to mindy ?	Bart Simpson
yes , what did happen to her ?	Marge Simpson
she hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job .	Homer Simpson
good . does anyone else have a love story ?	Marge Simpson
yes , i do . and just like your love stories , it 's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal .	Lisa Simpson
it started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on valentine 's day ...	Lisa Simpson
poor ralph .	Lisa Simpson
here you go , ralph .	Lisa Simpson
it was an unusually warm february 14th , so the children walked home without jackets .	Lisa Simpson
sure , i guess .	Lisa Simpson
glad you liked it .	Lisa Simpson
yeah . nice gag .	Lisa Simpson
well , here 's my house .	Lisa Simpson
oh , no . it 's a package from ralph .	Lisa Simpson
oh , a malibu stacy convertible ! `` look in the tunk . '' he must mean trunk .	Lisa Simpson
tickets to the krusty anniversary show !	Lisa Simpson
no , thanks .	Lisa Simpson
aw .	Lisa Simpson
oh no . please do n't show me with ralph .	Lisa Simpson
noooo ! !	Lisa Simpson
now you listen to me -- i do n't like you . i never liked you , and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would !	Lisa Simpson
watch this , lis . you can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half .	Bart Simpson
a-a-a-a-and , now .	Bart Simpson
lisa , not all romances turn out that way . bart , do you have a love story that does n't end in heartbreak ?	Marge Simpson
yes , i do . the only girl i ever loved invited me up to the treehouse . she had something very important to tell me .	Bart Simpson
wait , that did end in heartbreak . thanks for opening up old wounds , you ma .	Bart Simpson
well , as jerry lee lewis would say : `` there 's a whole lotta frowning going on . ''	Marge Simpson
mom , does n't any love story have a happy ending ?	Lisa Simpson
of course . remember when ... your aunt selma got married ?	Marge Simpson
oh , wait , wait , that 's no good . i know , your grandfather .	Marge Simpson
it all started on an outing for dinner ...	Marge Simpson
say ! i 've got a neat idea . why do n't you go in and pick up my mother , and we 'll all go out to dinner .	Marge Simpson
that 's not my mother .	Marge Simpson
they hit it off right away . but there were rivals for the fair lady 's hand ...	Marge Simpson
but in the end , just when things looked worse , true love triumphed .	Marge Simpson
that did n't seem like a happy ending .	Lisa Simpson
that seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation .	Lisa Simpson
i give up . did anybody learn anything about love tonight ?	Marge Simpson
i learned it screws everybody up .	Bart Simpson
there 's that side of it . but there 's also ... help me out here , lisa .	Marge Simpson
sorry , mom . i 've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me .	Lisa Simpson
soon , corey , soon .	Lisa Simpson
well , kids , i tried . maybe you 're right .	Marge Simpson
wait a minute , marge . love is n't hopeless . look , maybe i 'm no expert on the subject . but there was one time i got it right ...	Homer Simpson

but not the last .	Homer Simpson
mmmm , homie ...	Marge Simpson

dad ! remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , everything 's too damned expensive these days . look at this bible i just got . fifteen bucks ! and talk about a preachy book ! everybody 's a sinner except for this guy .	Homer Simpson
but now itchy & scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in half . can we go , dad ? can we can we can we , take it , lis .	Bart Simpson

you know , itchy and scratchy land is n't just for kids . they have a place called parents island .	Lisa Simpson
hmm ?	Marge Simpson
yeah . `` dancing , bowling , fashionable shops , over one hundred bars and saloons , and a world class chemical dependency center . ''	Lisa Simpson
tv town ! hammock land !	Homer Simpson
oooh . recipe-related bumper cars .	Marge Simpson
yayyyy !	Lisa Simpson
now wait a minute . i 'm not sure about this . every time we 've ever gone on vacation , i end up being horribly embarrassed , we end up in a big fight , and we come home more miserable than when we left . you have to promise me that this is n't going to happen this time .	Marge Simpson
embarrassed ? what are you talking about ?	Homer Simpson
well , there was our trip to the amish country ...	Marge Simpson
oh yes .	Homer Simpson
hey , look marge ! they 're still not fightin ' back ! i can be a jerk and no one can stop me ! hee hee hee hee !	Homer Simpson
even worse was our trip to sandy beach .	Marge Simpson

... and remember , every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa 's little helper . do you want me to write any of this down ?	Marge Simpson
okay , bye-bye / bye / bye , grampa .	Lisa Simpson

what 's the matter with you , homer ? we do n't have any fruits or vegetables in the car .	Marge Simpson
the whole trunk 's full of 'em , marge .	Homer Simpson
now , to absorb some local color through the magic of am radio .	Homer Simpson
have n't we stood in five different states long enough ?	Lisa Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
do n't mind if i do .	Homer Simpson
we 'd better find a motel and stop for the night .	Marge Simpson
we do n't need to do that , marge . i 'm not tired . i 'm not tired at all .	Homer Simpson
whew . i 'm glad that was n't us .	Bart Simpson
north . `` south . '' nuts to this ! i 'm going to take a shortcut .	Homer Simpson

well , okay . if it 's fun . let 's see ...	Homer Simpson
i 'll take eleven hundred dollars worth .	Homer Simpson
cool ! / neat-o !	Lisa Simpson
such a violent motif .	Marge Simpson
yeah , but it 's just pretend violence , which is actually beneficial for children .	Bart Simpson
ow !	Lisa Simpson
ow !	Bart Simpson
oh , please . it was just a figure of speech .	Marge Simpson
when do you show the consequences ? on tv , that mouse pulled out that cat 's lungs and played them like a bagpipe . but in the next scene , the cat was breathing comfortably .	Marge Simpson
i 'll have the brain burger with extra pus , please .	Bart Simpson
bart !	Marge Simpson
eyeball stew .	Homer Simpson
homer ! we just got here and already i 'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior .	Marge Simpson
i was just ordering a cheeseburger , mom . they have violent names for everything here .	Bart Simpson
oh , i see . all right . i 'll have the baby guts .	Marge Simpson
mom , that 's veal .	Lisa Simpson

tortureland , explosion land , searing gas pain land , unnecessary surgery land ...	Marge Simpson
oh look ! it 's the twelve noon robot parade ! hurry up or we 'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade .	Homer Simpson
wow , this is so much like my dreams it 's scary .	Bart Simpson
awww , look at that cute little baby axe .	Lisa Simpson
it 's cute , but i 'm sure it 's very sharp , and probably dirty .	Marge Simpson
see all that stuff in there , homer ? that 's why your robot never worked .	Marge Simpson
this is just what i was hoping for . spending the day together as a family .	Marge Simpson
ah , you know , part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals .	Marge Simpson
parents island ?	Homer Simpson
yuh-huh . i 'm sure we 'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner . are you kids gon na be alright ?	Marge Simpson
kids ?	Marge Simpson

well you 're probably too young to remember the short-lived itchy & scratchy and friends hour . they had to come up with some friends . there 's disgruntled goat , uncle ant , klu klux clam ...	Bart Simpson
oh yeah . they were n't very funny .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know , disgruntled goat had his moments .	Bart Simpson
it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over .	Marge Simpson
thank you !	Homer Simpson
i wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us ?	Lisa Simpson
wan na get a snow cone ?	Bart Simpson
okay .	Lisa Simpson
so , mr. itchy . you think you 're god 's gift to women , do ya ?	Bart Simpson

i 'm so embarrassed . i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die .	Marge Simpson

i have nothing to say to you .	Marge Simpson
but marge , i was a political prisoner .	Homer Simpson

who would 've thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land would turn out to be our best vacation ever .	Bart Simpson
yeah , best ever .	Lisa Simpson
are you two bonkers ? we almost got killed , not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered .	Marge Simpson
but mom , it 's exactly what you wanted in a vacation . it brought us together as a family , we got a lot of good exercise outdoors , and we have so many memories .	Lisa Simpson
you know , you 're right . this truly was the best vacation ever . now , let us never speak of it again .	Marge Simpson
but there are five of us .	Homer Simpson
that 's better .	Homer Simpson
i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny , but it 's not so funny when that violence is happening to you .	Marge Simpson
but it would be funny to someone who was watching us .	Bart Simpson
no , mom . he 's right . observe .	Lisa Simpson
ow !	Bart Simpson
oh my . lisa , go to your room .	Marge Simpson
nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh , guys . now , i 'm not very political -- i usually think people who vote are a bit `` fruit-y '' -- but , for some reason , this birch barlow really speaks to me ...	Homer Simpson
this sounds awfully controversial . lisa , you know i do n't like controversy in this house .	Marge Simpson
i do n't like him either mom , but i 'm doing a report on local politics for my school project .	Lisa Simpson
you think you 're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects . well , um ... i 'm doing a school project on , uh , fireworks !	Bart Simpson
bart , i wish you would n't lie like that .	Marge Simpson

when i 'm driving the car , i get to choose the radio station . when you 're driving , we 'll listen to your radio station .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't take this anymore . let 's switch back .	Homer Simpson
that sounds like sideshow bob !	Lisa Simpson
yes , ma'am . sideshow bob . yakkin ' it up on the ol ' yak-box .	Homer Simpson
dad , i 'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you do n't know who sideshow bob is .	Lisa Simpson
phew .	Homer Simpson
sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown 's sidekick . but in 1990 , he framed krusty for armed robbery and bart got him put in jail .	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
when he got out , he married aunt selma and tried to murder her .	Lisa Simpson

i thought this was a secret ballot .	Lisa Simpson
okay , aaron a. aaronson voted for ... bob . aaron l. aaronson voted for ... bob . arthur b. ablabab voted for ... bob .	Lisa Simpson
hey !	Lisa Simpson

i have a plan . i think we can trap him .	Lisa Simpson

because we all know you 're a naive pawn , puppet , if you will , of the most diabolical political genius springfield has ever known -- birchibald t. barlow !	Lisa Simpson
you do n't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself , do you ?	Lisa Simpson
you were just barlow 's lackey !	Bart Simpson

right there , put it right there . oh , excellent . you 're incredible , jessica . your throws , your catches , your spirals , your loops , it 's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ? i 'll prove it .	Bart Simpson
hey , jessica .	Bart Simpson
jessica we just ...	Bart Simpson
why ?	Bart Simpson
i guess .	Bart Simpson
um , actually , i was hoping i could sit down for just a second .	Bart Simpson
wow . now i have the energy to do anything !	Bart Simpson
just give me two minutes .	Bart Simpson
jessica , i think this is too steep .	Bart Simpson
actually , if the road surface maintains its integrity , i just might be able to hold on .	Bart Simpson
oh , the glue will slow me down .	Bart Simpson
nothin 's ever gon na stop me .	Bart Simpson
nooooo !	Bart Simpson
have you noticed any change in bart ?	Marge Simpson
new glasses ?	Homer Simpson
no . he looks like something might be disturbing him .	Marge Simpson
probably misses his old glasses .	Homer Simpson
i guess we could get more involved in bart 's activities . but then i 'd be afraid of smothering him .	Marge Simpson
yeah , and then we 'd get the chair .	Homer Simpson
that 's not what i meant .	Marge Simpson
it was , marge . admit it .	Homer Simpson
uh , we should get to class .	Bart Simpson
we could get in trouble for being late .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe it , bart . i 'd always thought jessica was so sweet .	Lisa Simpson
she 's like a milk dud , lis . sweet on the outside , poison on the inside .	Bart Simpson
you got ta give her up .	Lisa Simpson
no , no , wait . hear my plan . i put up with her for seven more years . then , we 'll get married . once the first baby comes along , she 's bound to settle down and start treatin ' me right . after all , i deserve it .	Bart Simpson
bart , it 's naive to think you can change a person . except maybe that boy who works in the library .	Lisa Simpson
well read and just a little wild . if only someone could tame him .	Lisa Simpson
you 're right , lisa -- love is n't about fixing someone . i 'm just going to give her up cold turkey . i 'm not gon na talk to her or see her . it 's over . thanks for the advice , sis .	Bart Simpson
there . if i can just get through this many days without seeing her , she should be completely out of my system . okay , day one .	Bart Simpson
time for church , bart . i bet your little friend jessica will be there .	Marge Simpson
jessica ...	Bart Simpson
bart , be strong . you do n't need that little hell cat .	Lisa Simpson
oh lis , she 's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song .	Bart Simpson
that 's very disturbing .	Bart Simpson
well , jessica , i do n't think we should hang out together anymore . you 're turning me into a criminal when all i want to be is a petty thug .	Bart Simpson
oh good , here comes the collection plate .	Homer Simpson
thirty cents off shake ' n bake . homer !	Marge Simpson
we can spare it , marge . we 've been blessed .	Homer Simpson
jessica , what are you doing !	Bart Simpson
but stealing from the collection basket is really wrong . even i know that .	Bart Simpson
i ...	Bart Simpson
stop him ! he 's headed for the window !	Homer Simpson
son , if you can look me in the eye and say you did n't take the collection money , that 's all i need .	Homer Simpson
i did n't take it .	Bart Simpson
why you little ... how can you look me in the eye and lie like that ? !	Homer Simpson
homer , stop that . i believe him .	Marge Simpson
tell me , if he did n't take the money , why is he wearing those fancy clothes ?	Homer Simpson
that 's what he wore to church .	Marge Simpson
ooo , how convenient .	Homer Simpson
bart honey , do you know who did take the money ?	Marge Simpson
no .	Bart Simpson
see , son ? telling the truth is n't so bad .	Homer Simpson
we 've got ta talk .	Bart Simpson
well , it seems like if you really care for me , you should come forward .	Bart Simpson
that does n't make any sense .	Bart Simpson
jessica , you 're really beautiful , but you are not very nice .	Bart Simpson
you know , with the way you 're treating me , why should i protect you ?	Bart Simpson
huh ?	Bart Simpson
so here 's where you 're hiding .	Lisa Simpson
yeah . this is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople .	Bart Simpson
bart , we ca n't just let her get away with this .	Lisa Simpson
give it up , lis . she 's a criminal mastermind . she 's got a 108 iq , she reads at a fifth grade level , and her hair smells like red fruit loops .	Bart Simpson
yeah , well i eat fruit loops for breakfast .	Lisa Simpson
we really should n't have let them do this . it ca n't be helping his self esteem .	Marge Simpson
i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof . but does n't the bible teach us `` judge not lest ye be judged , '' reverend ?	Lisa Simpson
there is someone among us with a guilty conscience . after much soul searching i decided it would be wrong of me to name names , but i urge that guilty person here , under the eyes of god , to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell .	Lisa Simpson
i am talking to the collection money thief . only you can come forward and end this injustice .	Lisa Simpson
oh , what the heck , it was jessica lovejoy .	Lisa Simpson
if you search her room , i am certain you will find the money .	Lisa Simpson
to the little girl 's room !	Homer Simpson
uh , i think you all owe my son an apology .	Marge Simpson
that 's okay . 'preciate it ... mm hmm .	Bart Simpson
hi , jessica .	Bart Simpson
i just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience , i really learned a lot ... i 'm a little wiser and a little less naã¯ve .	Bart Simpson
well , do n't you see , jessica , then you really have n't learned --	Bart Simpson
will i !	Bart Simpson
poor sucker . it 's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face . not me though . wait 'll she sees the second rate job i do on these stairs . .	Bart Simpson
ah , action news , the last place an impressionable kid can go for tv violence .	Bart Simpson
all right , snow day ! no school tomorrow !	Bart Simpson
that does n't mean you do n't have to do your book report . what if the weatherman is wrong ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , that man is a professional meteorologist .	Bart Simpson
i like those odds .	Homer Simpson
snowball fight !	Lisa Simpson
you 're gon na eat a blizzard of ...	Bart Simpson
unseasonable warmth ... ?	Bart Simpson
i made the snowball from the frost in our freezer .	Lisa Simpson
of course she did . who else would have ?	Bart Simpson
i 'm saved ! i love being a s-s-s-simpson !	Bart Simpson
huh ? !	Bart Simpson
mrs. krabappel , i did n't ...	Bart Simpson
grades are all i have . what could i be failing ? i 'm smart and a teacher 's pet .	Lisa Simpson
gym ? ! ! that 's the stupidest thing i ever heard .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , your father and i are very concerned about this warning . i really hope you try harder .	Marge Simpson
whew , that 's all of 'em . and i 'm so proud you did n't try to forge my name . how 'bout a present , son ?	Homer Simpson
well , i could use a new pair of hockey skates .	Bart Simpson
done and done .	Homer Simpson
that 's not fair ... why is bart getting a present and i 'm getting chewed out ?	Lisa Simpson
ah , the mysteries of life .	Homer Simpson
you mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory ?	Lisa Simpson
mom , this is really scary . i 'm gon na get my first ' f ' ever .	Lisa Simpson
cheer up . so you 're not good at sports . it 's a very small part of life .	Marge Simpson
sports , sports , sports , sports . sports , sports , sports , sports . marge , bart rides up in the front seat today because he 's a good guy at sports .	Homer Simpson
i mean my little girl buddy .	Homer Simpson
i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight . how about letting her ride up front , too ?	Marge Simpson
i tried .	Homer Simpson
okay , son , just remember to have fun out there today , and if you lose , i 'll kill you .	Homer Simpson
... dad .	Bart Simpson
ooooh .	Lisa Simpson
well boy , you won . so i 'm gon na live up to my side of the agreement . here 's your turtle , alive and well .	Homer Simpson
aw thanks , dad .	Bart Simpson
how about some adulation from my li ' l sister ?	Bart Simpson
wow bart , i 'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a concussion .	Lisa Simpson
ah , you 're just jealous ...	Bart Simpson
because - you - stink - at - sports ...	Bart Simpson
cut it out , bart !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , if the bible has taught us nothing else , and it has n't , it 's that girls should stick to girl sports , such as hot oil wrestling , foxy boxing , and such and such .	Homer Simpson
oh ! ooh my - oh , the hell with it .	Homer Simpson
well , i think women should be able to play any sport men play , but hockey is so violent and dangerous . look at milhouse 's teeth .	Marge Simpson
mom , will you stop showin ' us those ?	Bart Simpson
i have to join the team , or i 'll get an `` f '' that will haunt me for the rest of my life .	Lisa Simpson
he said it was just a name .	Lisa Simpson
okay , hotshots , now that my daughter is on your team , i want to make a few things clear .	Homer Simpson
please , dad , i 'll be fine .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she 's different . no jokes , no taunting ... look ! that kid 's got bosoms ! who 's got a wet towel ?	Homer Simpson
come here , you butterball .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't even watch . i do n't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she 's out there probably scared to death .	Marge Simpson
we 're laughing with her , marge ! there 's a big difference .	Homer Simpson
with her .	Homer Simpson
you really think i did okay out there , mom ?	Lisa Simpson
absolutely , honey . by blocking the net i really think you helped your team .	Marge Simpson
okay , little buddy , hop in !	Homer Simpson
that 's very nice , dad , but it 's wrong for you to reward violent , competitive behavior . however , i will sit up front with you if it 's a fatherly gesture of love .	Lisa Simpson
okay , hon .	Homer Simpson
sucker . competitive , violent , that 's why you 're here .	Homer Simpson
maybe i will , milhouse , maybe i will .	Bart Simpson
sorry .	Bart Simpson
lay off , guys . he 's with me .	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry , bart , they wo n't bother you anymore .	Lisa Simpson

ah , sorry bart , lisa and i are going out for gelato . we 'd ask you to come but , you know ...	Homer Simpson
bart , i can spend some time with you .	Marge Simpson
i dunno , mom .	Bart Simpson
do n't have a stereotypical view of me just because i 'm your mother . i know . how about we play the basketball ? i 'm no harvey globetrotter , but ...	Marge Simpson

hello , queen lisa .	Bart Simpson
bart , what are you doing in my room ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , certain differences , rivalries , if you will , have come up between us . at first i thought we can talk it over like civilized people . but instead , i just ripped the head off mr. honeybunny .	Bart Simpson
bart , that was your cherished childhood toy .	Lisa Simpson
mr. honeybunny !	Bart Simpson
quiet down , bart !	Homer Simpson
bart , just get out of here .	Lisa Simpson
hey ! it 's a free country . you get out .	Bart Simpson

okay , but on my way , i 'm gon na be doing this .	Bart Simpson
if you get hit , it 's your own fault .	Bart Simpson

ma-arge . they ca n't carry enough candy . they have puny , little muscles , not big , ropey ones like you .	Homer Simpson
homer , are all these pockets necessary ?	Marge Simpson
they would n't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair .	Homer Simpson
well , that 's the babysitter . no one in town will sit for you two anymore . i had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo .	Marge Simpson

marge , i swear i did n't touch her . you know how bashful i am . i ca n't even say the word `` titmouse '' without giggling like a schoolgirl .	Homer Simpson
at any rate , i believe you and i think you should go outside and straighten this out . some of their chants are very catchy and memorable .	Marge Simpson
oh that . no . i was just grabbing a gummy venus de milo that got stuck to your pants .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , i 'm a decent guy ...	Homer Simpson
why would anybody want to touch a girl 's butt ? that 's where cooties come from .	Bart Simpson
dad , i do n't understand . what is she saying you did ?	Lisa Simpson
well lisa , remember that post card grampa sent us from florida of that alligator biting that woman 's bottom ?	Homer Simpson
oh , yeah . that was brilliant .	Bart Simpson
that 's right , we all thought it was hilarious . but it turns out we were wrong . that alligator was sexually harassing that woman .	Homer Simpson
and the dog in the coppertone ad ? same deal , dad ?	Bart Simpson
well , that 's kind of a gray area .	Homer Simpson
we know you 're innocent , dad .	Bart Simpson
thanks , kids .	Homer Simpson
they seem to be building some sort of a shantytown .	Marge Simpson
homer ! wake up ! wake up !	Marge Simpson
do your worst , protesters you ca n't stop me from living my life !	Homer Simpson
it 's okay , they 're with me .	Homer Simpson

homer --	Marge Simpson

oh , i would n't want to be mr. t right now .	Homer Simpson
homer ! homie ! the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name !	Marge Simpson
the media 's making a monster out of you because they do n't care about the truth . all they care about is entertainment . well you need a forum where they do n't even know the meaning of the word `` entertainment '' -- public access television .	Lisa Simpson
but those shows all look so crummy .	Homer Simpson
well , we can dress it up a bit . we can bring a fern ... and a folding chair from the garage ... and the most decorative thing of all : the truth .	Marge Simpson
there are only forty-nine stars on that flag .	Marge Simpson
now it 's time for the innocence report with homer simpson .	Lisa Simpson
hello . i am homer simpson , or as some of you wags have dubbed me , `` father goose . '' you know , everybody believed the worst about me right away . nobody cares that i did n't do it . but i did n't . okay , look , i 've done some bad things in my life , but harassing women is not one of them . like , one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front . so i figured , `` we 'll see about that . '' so i get this big chunk of cinderblock and i ...	Homer Simpson
oh , got ta go . innocent !	Homer Simpson

you want me to spend more time with dad ? what about my new year 's resolution ?	Homer Simpson
you could make a lot of money .	Marge Simpson
yeah ... where are my pants ?	Homer Simpson
you threw them out the window in a fit of passion . you said you were never going to need them again .	Marge Simpson
hoo mama ! this is finally really happening . after years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes , i know i 'm gon na get rich with this scheme ! and quick !	Homer Simpson
sir ! hello , sir ! yes , you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife !	Homer Simpson
ow . i guess people have some sort of `` moral objection '' to our sex-drug .	Homer Simpson
listen to this . `` unexplainable behavior . individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with ufos , or other paranormal phenomena , e.g . telephone explosions . ''	Bart Simpson
scary , no ? and this guy 's head of the spaceology department at the correspondence college of tampa !	Bart Simpson
great . i 'm gon na be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag .	Homer Simpson
that is correct .	Homer Simpson
they did n't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music .	Homer Simpson
okay . it 's now painfully clear . the adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people .	Bart Simpson
hey , hey , hey ! stop it ! stop it ! why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions ? have n't you heard of occam 's razor ? `` the simplest explanation is probably the correct one . ''	Lisa Simpson
so what 's the simplest explanation ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't know . maybe they 're all reverse vampires , and they have to get home before dark .	Lisa Simpson
ewww , why 're we stopping at this dump ?	Homer Simpson
wow . let 's go find that hot dog tree i planted .	Homer Simpson
ow !	Homer Simpson
dad , how come you never gave me any encouragement ? maybe i could 've been something more than i am , like a travel agent to a great scientist , or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm .	Homer Simpson
your whole life , you never said one nice thing to me .	Homer Simpson
you 're the screw-up !	Homer Simpson
all right ! that 's it . we 're goin ' home . i 'm sick of you and your stupid tonic !	Homer Simpson
get out .	Homer Simpson
out .	Homer Simpson
homie , are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life ?	Marge Simpson
of course not marge , just for the rest of his life . he said i was an accident . he did n't want to have me !	Homer Simpson
you did n't want to have bart .	Marge Simpson
i know , but you 're never supposed to tell the child .	Homer Simpson
you tell bart all the time . you told him this morning .	Marge Simpson
but when i do it , it 's cute .	Homer Simpson
so , finally , we 're all in agreement about what 's going on with the adults . milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
thank you .	Bart Simpson
kids , your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky ... nutty ... chewy ... chocolatey ... put it away , boy ... situation . and your daddy has realized something very important : a father should always make his kids feel wanted . starting right now , i promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve .	Homer Simpson
dad !	Homer Simpson
son ! my dear son . from now on i 'm going to be a good and attentive father . and for starters your `` old man '' is gon na teach you how to ride ... your very first bike !	Homer Simpson
dad , number one : i know how to ride a bike . number two : i already own a bike . and number three : that is a girl 's bike .	Bart Simpson
you 're no girl , you 're a boy . a good boy . you can be president . scratch that . you will be president .	Homer Simpson
dad !	Lisa Simpson
i think lisa needs another push on her new tire swing .	Homer Simpson
no , dad . i want to get down . this tire is filthy , and the steel belts are poking me .	Lisa Simpson
wheeee ! wheeee ! ! !	Homer Simpson
no ! no ! no ! no ! ! !	Lisa Simpson
no offense , homer , but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting .	Bart Simpson
b-but i 'm using my whole ass .	Homer Simpson
dad , it 's just that too much of your love can really be ... scary .	Lisa Simpson
some day you 'll thank me for all this scary love ! but now , i 've got ta go somewhere and do some serious thinking .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sure he meant to say `` serious drinking . ''	Bart Simpson
that 's what i assumed .	Lisa Simpson
here 's where it all started to go wrong . how 'm i supposed to be a good dad when i never had one myself ?	Homer Simpson
dad was n't even around on christmas morning when i actually got to meet santa claus . some father ... wait a minute .	Homer Simpson
dad ? this photo is a blessing . it eases my pain .	Homer Simpson
i 'm a screw-up . i burned down our house .	Homer Simpson
you know what ?	Homer Simpson
we 're both screw-ups .	Homer Simpson
so are you gon na say something nice now ?	Homer Simpson
aw , dad .	Homer Simpson
i 'm with you , dad .	Homer Simpson
this is gon na to be great .	Homer Simpson
ah , come on , everybody . this bar is like a tavern to me .	Homer Simpson
it 's raining men ?	Homer Simpson
jokes on them . i 'm still alive .	Homer Simpson
cheer up , homer .	Bart Simpson
ca n't .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Bart Simpson
what if you pretended that this couch were a bar ? then you could spend more nights at home with us . huh ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm not going to dignify that with an answer .	Homer Simpson
look on the bright side , dad . did you know that the chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity ?	Lisa Simpson
yes . cris-a-tunity . you 're right ! i 've been wasting my life away in that dump for years . that 's it . i 'm going to find a new bar to drink in . and i 'm gon na get drunker than i 've been in my entire life ! bart , where 's my wallet ?	Homer Simpson
right here , dad .	Bart Simpson
thank you !	Homer Simpson
wow , classy .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
hmmm . this looks like a nice , friendly place .	Homer Simpson
i just left my first session and i have n't even opened my mouth yet .	Marge Simpson
wait a minute . there 's something bothering me about this place . i know - this lesbian bar does n't have a fire exit . enjoy your death trap , ladies .	Homer Simpson
gr-aargh ! oh my god , this man is my exact double . that dog has a puffy tail !	Homer Simpson
here , puff ! here puff !	Homer Simpson
the last bar in springfield . if they do n't let me in here , i 'm gon na have to quit drinking .	Homer Simpson
shut up , liver .	Homer Simpson
ooh , my liver hurts .	Homer Simpson
i 'd like a beer , please .	Homer Simpson
uh , but i am a pilot .	Homer Simpson
i stowed it safely in the overhead compartment .	Homer Simpson
but i -	Homer Simpson
yeah , that 's exactly why i 'm here .	Homer Simpson
but , i keep tellin ' ya , i 'm not a pilot .	Homer Simpson
uh , yeah , um , uh as a change of pace , i 'm gon na let you do most of the work . i think you 're ready for it , alan .	Homer Simpson
and um , ah , i 'll just uh get us started ...	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
good news , everybody . because i endangered lives , we can fly anywhere we want .	Homer Simpson
alaska !	Bart Simpson
hawaii !	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know , homer . we 're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season .	Marge Simpson
but marge , you deserve a vacation . it 's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state .	Homer Simpson
i do n't want to be a wet blanket , but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden .	Marge Simpson
come on marge , i want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town . i want to explore the world . i want to watch tv in a different time zone . i want to visit strange exotic malls . i 'm sick of eating hoagies . i want a grinder , a sub , a foot-long hero . i want to live , marge ! wo n't you let me live ? wo n't you please ?	Homer Simpson
so marge , pretty sweet , eh ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer . if someone broke into the house and did laundry , it could start a fire .	Marge Simpson
oh , great . i specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby .	Bart Simpson
c'mon , bart . they 're gon na pamper us . not literally , of course .	Lisa Simpson
i come for the service , but i stay for the leg room .	Bart Simpson
i think i 'll go get a picture of the plane taking off .	Marge Simpson
see , dad . i told you mom would have problems .	Lisa Simpson
marge , what 's wrong ? are you hungry ? sleepy ? gassy ? gassy ? is it gas ? it 's gas , is n't it ?	Homer Simpson
homer , i 've never told you this before , but i 'm not a good flyer . i have to get off the plane . let me off the plane . i 'm asking you nicely to open the doors .	Marge Simpson
take it easy , marge . how 'bout if we dope you up real good ?	Homer Simpson
let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off ! let me off !	Marge Simpson
it 's okay , marge . we do n't need to go on a trip . we 'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us .	Homer Simpson
you know , i have this feeling that we forgot something ...	Bart Simpson
i 'm sure it 's nothing .	Homer Simpson
mom , are you feeling any better ?	Lisa Simpson
yes , but i 'd rather not talk about it .	Marge Simpson
permit me to solve the mystery . your mother has a fear of flying .	Homer Simpson
so much for the days when i could say `` at least my mother 's normal . ''	Bart Simpson
well , everybody 's got a fear of something .	Marge Simpson
not everybody .	Homer Simpson
sock puppets .	Marge Simpson
where ? where ?	Homer Simpson
mom , are you sure you do n't want to discuss it ?	Lisa Simpson
sure as sugar .	Marge Simpson
lisa , the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened . push it deep down inside her ... so she 'll never annoy us again .	Homer Simpson
but if we do n't encourage her to vent her feelings , they can come out in other ways .	Lisa Simpson
i just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog . they 've been living in sin .	Marge Simpson
mom , you 've been cooking all night ?	Lisa Simpson
judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one , you are .	Marge Simpson
no , no honey , it 's all right . really . i 'm fine . i 'm all right . mother always said `` do n't complain . be good . behave , behave . be nice , smile be polite , do n't make waves . ''	Marge Simpson
you heard your mother 's ramblings . she 's fine , so behave .	Homer Simpson
marge , it 's three a.m. should n't you be baking ?	Homer Simpson
in a little while .	Marge Simpson
mom , can we talk to you ?	Lisa Simpson
ca n't talk . keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness .	Marge Simpson
uh , neat ... anyway , mom , maybe you should go into therapy .	Lisa Simpson
mm , no , i do n't need therapy , i 'm fine . and it 's too expensive .	Marge Simpson
and i do n't believe in it . it breaks up families ... . turns wives against husbands ... children against fathers ... neighbors against me . you do n't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy .	Homer Simpson
but i ...	Marge Simpson
it 's raining men !	Homer Simpson
now marge , `` dear abby '' says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears . ooh , here are some upbeat titles . `` hero . '' `` fearless . '' `` alive . ''	Homer Simpson
dad , mom 's getting worse . you have to take her to see a real psychiatrist . look how tense she is .	Lisa Simpson
she 's fine .	Homer Simpson
oh .	Homer Simpson
every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself . well what about me , marge ?	Homer Simpson
all right , lisa , you got your way . your mom 's going to a psychiatrist . she 's gon na tell marge to leave me . it 'll break up the family , and you 'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans .	Homer Simpson
dad , i like picking beans with grandma .	Lisa Simpson
well keep it up , then .	Homer Simpson
okay , i will .	Lisa Simpson
good , you do that .	Homer Simpson
fine .	Lisa Simpson
you 'll be picking many a bean .	Homer Simpson
hope i do .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't believe it ! principal skinner !	Bart Simpson
well , well , well . i never thought i 'd win this easy .	Bart Simpson
bart , leave that man alone with his pain and sit down .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Bart Simpson
all right . how much do you charge ?	Homer Simpson
keep sliding .	Homer Simpson
thirty dollars will be fine .	Marge Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . first , what are your qualifications ?	Homer Simpson
oh , no , i 'm not here to take a reading test . i wan na see some credentials .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , doctor . he 's just afraid you 'll blame all my problems on him .	Marge Simpson
but it 's a few seconds before 12:00 .	Marge Simpson
you see ? ! you see ? ! `` i '' just left `` my '' first session and `` i '' have n't opened `` my '' mouth yet .	Homer Simpson
hmm . that would have to be my first day of school .	Marge Simpson
the kids at school were even worse .	Marge Simpson
they do so !	Marge Simpson
no ! no !	Marge Simpson
but it 's true . they did n't write their own songs or play their own instruments .	Marge Simpson
did you talk about me in therapy today ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't think so .	Marge Simpson
tell me the truth ! do n't tell her i raised my voice . do n't . happy family , happy family .	Homer Simpson
i keep having the same dream . i 'm the mother from `` lost in space . ''	Marge Simpson
ready for breakfast , doctor smith ?	Marge Simpson
oh , being stuck on this god forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite i have .	Homer Simpson
warning . warning . doctor smith refuses to do his astro chores .	Lisa Simpson
why , you clattering clank of ... . my dear lady , as you well know my back is a disaster area . d'oh the pain ! d'oh the pain of it all !	Homer Simpson
danger , danger ... my hooks are flailing wildly !	Lisa Simpson
wait ! daddy ! wait ! please do n't leave . take me with you !	Marge Simpson
no , i did n't .	Marge Simpson
sure , okay . i 'll talk about father . father christmas . that 's what they call santa claus in england . they drive on the wrong side of the road there . now that 's crazy . people are always saying how small england is . but you could n't fit it all in here . not by a long shot . you know what ? i 'm cured .	Marge Simpson
okay . okay ... but you 're gon na make a big deal outta this . he was a pilot .	Marge Simpson
you see .	Marge Simpson
wait . i 'm remembering something ...	Marge Simpson
i was a little girl ...	Marge Simpson
why does daddy have to leave ?	Marge Simpson
i want to see daddy fly !	Marge Simpson
daddy ? ! daddy , where are you , da ...	Marge Simpson
daddy ?	Marge Simpson
my father was a stewardess .	Marge Simpson
they are ?	Marge Simpson
yeah ... you might even say he was an american hero .	Marge Simpson
wait , some other stuff 's coming back to me .	Marge Simpson
you think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying ?	Marge Simpson
oh well , thank you , doctor , you 've changed my life !	Marge Simpson
that 's okay . you do n't have to make her into some kind of superwoman . she can get on a plane . that 's plenty .	Homer Simpson
thank you , doctor . whenever the wind whistles through the leaves i 'll think lowenstein , lowenstein .	Marge Simpson
lowenstein .	Marge Simpson
do n't worry about a thing , honey . i 'm gon na help you through this .	Homer Simpson
those are all normal noises . luggage compartment closing . cross-checking . just sit back and relax .	Homer Simpson
that 's just the engine powering up . that 's just the engine struggling .	Homer Simpson
that 's just a carp swimming around your ankles .	Homer Simpson
could you start fixing it pretty soon ? the basement is getting awfully flooded . and i think the cat 's down there .	Marge Simpson
oh dear .	Marge Simpson
what should we do until you get back ?	Homer Simpson
aw , it did n't work .	Homer Simpson
lousy traffic jams . the traffic report 'll get me outta this one .	Homer Simpson
hi , dad .	Bart Simpson
hey , how come you guys got such great parking places ?	Homer Simpson
all right , econo-save , you just made the list .	Homer Simpson
hey , will you guys help me fix my ...	Homer Simpson
hey , how come you guys got better chairs than me ?	Homer Simpson
hey , you guys wan na go bowling tonight ?	Homer Simpson
like what ?	Homer Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
i saved your life . that egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol .	Homer Simpson
so anyway , lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays . and they do n't tell me where they go . it 's like a conspiracy .	Homer Simpson
a conspiracy , eh ? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way ?	Bart Simpson
i do ... now . anyway , i 'm gon na follow them tonight and see where they go .	Homer Simpson
oh , homer . do n't start stalking people again . it 's so illegal . remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden ?	Marge Simpson
well , something did .	Homer Simpson
i do n't want you stalking anyone tonight .	Marge Simpson
oh , okay . have it your own way , marge . i 'll be back in a minute . i 'm going outside . to stalk ... ... lenny and carl .	Homer Simpson
all i have to do is follow the yellow drip road .	Homer Simpson
hee hee hee ! i can see everything . and they 're none the wiser , hee hee hee .	Homer Simpson
i saw weird stuff in that place last night . weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff . and i want in .	Homer Simpson
stonecutters , eh ? how do i join ?	Homer Simpson

so , one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too , huh ?	Homer Simpson
you 'd better run , egg !	Homer Simpson
why do n't people like me , marge ?	Homer Simpson
everyone likes you . you 're a wonderful person .	Marge Simpson
then why do n't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm sure it 's nothing personal , homer .	Marge Simpson
it is . it 's been happening to me all my life .	Homer Simpson
i felt so left out .	Homer Simpson
kids can be so cruel .	Marge Simpson
we can ? thanks , mom .	Bart Simpson
ow ! cut it out , bart .	Lisa Simpson
i 'd give anything to get into the stonecutters .	Homer Simpson
what do they do there , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
what do they do ? what do n't they do ! oh they do so many things ... they never stop ... oh the things they do there ! my stars .	Homer Simpson
you do n't know what they do there , do you ?	Lisa Simpson
not as such , no .	Homer Simpson
dad , remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore grampa ?	Bart Simpson
do i ever ! it 's five years later and i still think i 'm a chicken . i 'm a chicken , marge .	Homer Simpson
i know , i know .	Marge Simpson
maybe we should be listening to him now .	Bart Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
what ?	Homer Simpson
you 're a member of the stonecutters , grampa ?	Lisa Simpson
this is it . my ticket in . they have to let me join if i 'm the son of a member .	Homer Simpson
i 'll take this communist one too .	Homer Simpson

you outrank mr. burns here ?	Homer Simpson
is he the leader ?	Homer Simpson
okay , okay , i did n't ask for your life story .	Homer Simpson
i think i have to do it again . my blindfold came off .	Homer Simpson
hey , have you ever noticed that the `` crossing the desert '' is a lot like `` the unblinking eye '' and it 's exactly like `` the wreck of the hesperus '' ?	Homer Simpson
and by the sacred parchment i swear that if i reveal the secrets of the stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs .	Homer Simpson
oh really ?	Homer Simpson
really ?	Homer Simpson
but what if i were to shake your hand in this wise ?	Homer Simpson
heh heh heh ! so long , suckers !	Homer Simpson
same old space , huh , dad ?	Bart Simpson
yep , but they gave me these rollerblades so i can glide to the front door .	Homer Simpson
heh heh heh heh . sweet .	Homer Simpson
jealous ?	Homer Simpson
you 're jealous .	Homer Simpson
what 's this ?	Homer Simpson
everything lasts forever .	Homer Simpson
i still do n't believe all the founding fathers were stonecutters .	Lisa Simpson
that 's because you trust your stupid school books . here 's what really happened at the signing of the declaration of independence ...	Homer Simpson
you wan na see how davy crockett really died at the alamo ? you must be 18 .	Homer Simpson
homer , a man who called himself `` you know who '' just invited you to a secret `` wink wink '' at the `` you know what . '' you certainly are popular now that you 're a stonecutter .	Marge Simpson
oh , yeah . beer busts , beer blasts , keggers , stein hoists , aa meetings , beer night . it 's wonderful , marge . i 've never felt so accepted in all my life . these people looked deep within my soul , and assigned me a number based on the order in which i joined .	Homer Simpson
who rigs every oscar night ? /	Homer Simpson
uh-oh . i need a bib . if i slop any on my shirt , i could lose the respect of my beloved brethren .	Homer Simpson
the black panthers ?	Homer Simpson
huh ? oh . yeah . thanks , lenny .	Homer Simpson

woo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
wow . mental note . do n't overdo this .	Homer Simpson
peek-a-boo !	Homer Simpson
i always wondered if there was a god . and now i know . there is . and it 's me .	Homer Simpson
you 're not a god , homer .	Marge Simpson
remember , dad . all glory is fleeting .	Lisa Simpson
so ?	Homer Simpson
beware the ides of march .	Lisa Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
dad , i know you think you 're happy now , but it 's not gon na last forever .	Lisa Simpson
do n't you see ? getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless .	Lisa Simpson
remove the girl .	Homer Simpson
dad , you 're not with the stonecutters now . there are no lackeys around to carry out your every ...	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
i 'm out .	Homer Simpson
oh i win again , do n't i ? woo hoo .	Homer Simpson
you know , i think you guys are lettin ' me win .	Homer Simpson
from now on , i want you to be honest with me . i mean , i 'm not perfect , right ?	Homer Simpson
lisa , you were right . my happiness is fading .	Homer Simpson
you 're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings .	Lisa Simpson
what do you mean , isolated ? ... ated ... ated..ated..ated .	Homer Simpson
well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people .	Lisa Simpson
hm ... i could help others . i 'll get a bunch of monkeys , dress them up , and make them reenact the civil war .	Homer Simpson
dad , that does n't help people .	Lisa Simpson
could n't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people ... which they almost certainly would .	Homer Simpson
brothers , brothers .	Homer Simpson
aw , homie . you know , you are a member of a very exclusive club .	Marge Simpson
brothers , i 've learned a wonderful lesson . helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people . so instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer , let us stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate .	Homer Simpson
you were right , lisa . i 've never felt so spiritually fulfilled . and with my brothers , the stonecutters , behind me , this is the beginning of a better world for all of us .	Homer Simpson
hey , fellas . can i join ?	Homer Simpson
loyal stonecutters , let us begin our reenactment of the battle of gettysburg .	Homer Simpson
homer , you ca n't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys . somebody 's gon na get parasites .	Marge Simpson
oh marge , kids , i miss my club .	Homer Simpson
no . the family simpson , which has just five members . and only two of those members have special rings .	Marge Simpson
yeah !	Lisa Simpson
i meant our wedding rings .	Marge Simpson
you know , marge you 're right . the simpson family is the best possible club i could belong to .	Homer Simpson
this club 'd better be worth it .	Homer Simpson
all right , all right . it 's lisa 's turn .	Marge Simpson
go knightboat , go !	Homer Simpson
every week there 's a canal .	Bart Simpson
or an inlet .	Lisa Simpson
or a fjord .	Bart Simpson
quiet . i will not hear another word against the boat .	Homer Simpson
okay , tv off . it 's family time .	Marge Simpson
but marge , knightboat . the crime solving boat .	Homer Simpson
homer , you promised . one night of family time a week . besides , that back-talking boat sets a bad example .	Marge Simpson
says you , woman .	Bart Simpson
all right , family time begins now .	Marge Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
it was bart .	Homer Simpson
why do n't we all look at the photo album ?	Lisa Simpson
so many memories . aw , look ... knightboat .	Homer Simpson
aw .	Lisa Simpson
thanks honey . bank shot .	Homer Simpson
and here 's our tv next to the mirror . it looks like we have two .	Homer Simpson
wow . two .	Bart Simpson
yeah , yeah , yeah two . let 's get to the baby pictures .	Marge Simpson
moom .	Homer Simpson
that 's exciting .	Homer Simpson
oh please .	Bart Simpson
here 's bart sleeping ... here he is dozing ... here he is after a visit from the sandman ... ooh , here 's nappy-time bart ... here 's a cute one , he 's all tuckered out ...	Marge Simpson
why are n't there any pictures of maggie ?	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm glad you asked . it 's actually a very interesting story .	Homer Simpson
it all began about two years ago , before maggie was even born . bart , you were lisa 's age and lisa you were the age bart was several years ago .	Homer Simpson
get the camera ready , bart very seepy .	Bart Simpson
listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show . it was a tumultuous time for our nation . the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live .	Homer Simpson
the information super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about `` star trek , '' and the domestication of the dog continued unabated .	Homer Simpson
i was at my work station when suddenly ...	Homer Simpson
not on my shift .	Homer Simpson
oh no you do n't !	Homer Simpson
simpson ten , terrorists eight .	Homer Simpson
homer ! tell the story right .	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! this is it ! with this single glorious check , i 'm finally completely out of debt .	Homer Simpson
good aim , dad .	Lisa Simpson
yes ! with my bills paid off , i can finally quit this lousy job .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry about homer j. i 've got a plan . a plan that 'll fix you good .	Homer Simpson
sorry , that just slipped out . i 'll miss ya .	Homer Simpson
did you hear me ? i said , i quit , monty . and since i quit , i can do anything i want .	Homer Simpson
ooh , lovely desk . it would be too bad if someone , oh , i do n't know ... did n't use a coaster ! !	Homer Simpson
such a nice tidy office . maybe it 's time you started living like a pig !	Homer Simpson
oh , i hope i have n't upset you ... bongo head !	Homer Simpson
that 's for employing me for eight years ! ha ha .	Homer Simpson
and that is that . goodbye mind-numbing , back-breaking labor forever . hello dream job in paradise .	Homer Simpson
and now the final phase of my plan .	Homer Simpson
hey barney , any chance you can get me a job here ?	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
why ?	Homer Simpson
you 're a pin-monkey ? wow . finally i do n't have to be ashamed of my father 's job .	Bart Simpson
i think it 's romantic . throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream ... of sorts .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know if it 's such a good idea . can we get by on a pin-monkey salary ?	Marge Simpson
do n't worry , marge . i 've come up with a perfectly balanced budget . there will be exactly enough money for you , me , bart and lisa , if we make a few small sacrifices .	Homer Simpson
from now on we use regular toilet paper , not that fancy quilted kind ...	Homer Simpson
and only one of you kids can go to college .	Homer Simpson
fine .	Lisa Simpson
that night your mother and i went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life . we began with dinner and dancing ... followed by a stroll on the beach ...	Homer Simpson
marge ...	Homer Simpson
homer ...	Marge Simpson
i 've got sand in my underpants .	Homer Simpson
me too . let 's go home .	Marge Simpson
i love you , marge .	Homer Simpson
i love you too , homie .	Marge Simpson
everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced . i hope things stay exactly like this forever .	Homer Simpson
did you have to be so graphic ?	Marge Simpson
it 's okay , marge . they pave the way for this kind of filth in school .	Homer Simpson
so dad , were you excited that mom was pregnant ?	Lisa Simpson

you 're pregnant ? !	Homer Simpson
and then when i told him about lisa ...	Marge Simpson

this was the happiest time of my life . i 'll never forget you guys . especially you , joey .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , joey . we 'll make it to california some day .	Homer Simpson
i needed more money to support my growing family . and there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it .	Homer Simpson
actually , i quit and i came to get my job back .	Homer Simpson
seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it .	Homer Simpson
thanks for giving me my old job back .	Homer Simpson
i 've never been so miserable in all my life . but i ca n't take it out on marge and the kids . i 've got to carry the burden all by myself .	Homer Simpson

i knew you 'd try to find something wrong with my comet lisa . you 've always been petty and small . right from the beginning .	Bart Simpson
hey , shut up .	Bart Simpson
will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet ? it 's going to be destroyed . did n't you hear what the guy in the building said ?	Homer Simpson
but , dad , do n't you think ...	Lisa Simpson
lisa , the whole reason we have elected officials is so we do n't have to think all the time . just like that rain forest scare a few years back . our officials saw there was a problem , and they fixed it . did n't they ?	Homer Simpson
no , dad , i do n't think ...	Lisa Simpson
there 's that word again .	Homer Simpson
homer , what if this does n't work ?	Marge Simpson
well then , i have a back-up plan . see , while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo ...	Homer Simpson
dad , the plan !	Bart Simpson
i 'm getting to that . so anyway , they 're going , doo-dee-doo-do-doo ...	Homer Simpson
dad !	Bart Simpson

it blew up the bridge !	Lisa Simpson
we 're doomed !	Bart Simpson

just a second .	Homer Simpson
what 's everyone so worked up about ? so there 's a comet . big deal . it 'll burn up in our atmosphere , and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua 's head .	Homer Simpson
wow , dad . maybe you 're right .	Bart Simpson
of course i 'm right . if i 'm not , may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow .	Homer Simpson
okay , if you 're that worried about it , let 's go down to the bomb shelter .	Homer Simpson

and it was a baby ox .	Homer Simpson
look !	Marge Simpson
it 's breaking up !	Lisa Simpson
cool !	Bart Simpson
we 're saved !	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that i 've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet .	Lisa Simpson
what 's really amazing is that this is exactly what dad said would happen .	Bart Simpson
yeah , dad was right .	Lisa Simpson
i know kids , i 'm scared too .	Homer Simpson
when krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away .	Lisa Simpson

hurry up -- it 's my first day of clown college .	Homer Simpson
hold still , homer . do n't squirm .	Marge Simpson
dad , you ca n't just go around pretending to be krusty . it 's sacrilege . he 's a one and only . i mean , he invented the pie fight , the prat fall , and the seltzer bottle ... as far as i know .	Bart Simpson

oh yeah . when i started this clown thing i thought it would be nothing but glory . you know , the glory of being a clown ? i tell ya , it 's hard , tiring work , but when i see the smiles on their little faces , i just know they 're getting ready to jab me with something .	Homer Simpson

when will you australians learn ? in america , we 've stopped using corporal punishment , and things have never been better . the streets are safe . old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys . and the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities . so , like us , let your children run wild and free . because , as the old saying goes , let your children run wild and free . now boy , run back to the embassy ! back to american soil !	Homer Simpson

a little too well , if you ask me . i 'm sure he 's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies .	Homer Simpson
dogs ! chief , you 're getting powdered sugar all over my floor !	Marge Simpson
we do n't have to wait for the cops - who can track the puppies better than their own mom and dad ?	Bart Simpson
let 's go find your babies !	Lisa Simpson
dinner 's on , dogs !	Marge Simpson
who knows what horrible things he 's doing to those innocent little puppies ?	Lisa Simpson
he 's giving them a bath !	Lisa Simpson
maybe we were wrong about burns on this one .	Lisa Simpson
he 's gon na make a tuxedo out of our puppies ! ! !	Lisa Simpson
bart !	Lisa Simpson
sorry . you 've got ta admit it 's catchy .	Bart Simpson
we 've got ta get the dogs outta there !	Bart Simpson
ssh .	Lisa Simpson
hush , puppies !	Bart Simpson
we 've got ta get you outta here !	Lisa Simpson
i know , the window !	Bart Simpson
no bart ! what 're you doing ?	Lisa Simpson
dogs always land on their feet .	Bart Simpson
that 's cats .	Lisa Simpson
no , it 's dogs . i 'll prove it .	Bart Simpson
best two out of three .	Bart Simpson
bart , look ! a laundry chute !	Lisa Simpson
okay guys , let 's move !	Bart Simpson
come on ! come on !	Bart Simpson
i 've got an idea !	Lisa Simpson
sorry , monty , but you 're too big for this ride .	Bart Simpson

that 's impossible ! how did you get here first ?	Bart Simpson
but they 're ours ! you stole them from us !	Lisa Simpson

no , do n't ! stay down , monty ! do n't get up ! stay down ! stay down , boy !	Lisa Simpson
nooo ! !	Lisa Simpson
well , mr. burns , i hope you 've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion .	Lisa Simpson
homer ! for the love of god , no .	Marge Simpson
marge , you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds .	Homer Simpson
well , at least it 's safer than the old bus .	Bart Simpson
it 's hard to see what 's going on . i can only make out the fat soldiers .	Bart Simpson
ah , i think i got your lunch .	Bart Simpson
oh , yeah . i did n't think this was for me .	Lisa Simpson
i 've never seen them fight like that , bart . i 'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike .	Lisa Simpson
strike , eh ?	Bart Simpson
oww ! my bones are so brittle . but i always drink plenty of ... malk ?	Bart Simpson
i saw you two fighting . i 'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down .	Bart Simpson
yeah , skinner said you would n't have the wontons to go through with it .	Bart Simpson
well , i had to clean it up a little .	Bart Simpson
but basically , krabappel said you 'd give the teachers everything they want .	Bart Simpson
yeah . she said you 'd fold faster than superman on laundry day .	Bart Simpson
thank you , sir .	Bart Simpson
oh no . strike ?	Lisa Simpson
bart ! lisa ! what are you two doing home so early ?	Marge Simpson
great news , mom !	Bart Simpson
horrible news , mom !	Lisa Simpson
the school 's on strike . maybe forever . overload . pleasure overload .	Bart Simpson
luckily i 've prepared for this , so i 'm not too worried .	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah .	Lisa Simpson
bart , leave that crowbar here . you know i do n't like you prying and jimmying .	Marge Simpson
awesome .	Bart Simpson
you with the crane , spin around real fast .	Bart Simpson
now you , dump three tons of sand onto that port-a-potty .	Bart Simpson
lousy teachers . trying to palm off our kids on us .	Homer Simpson
but dad , by striking they 're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , if you do n't like your job you do n't strike . you just go in every day and do it really half-assed . that 's the american way .	Homer Simpson
i 've got some textbooks , but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far .	Lisa Simpson
honey , maybe you should relax a little ?	Marge Simpson
relax ? i ca n't relax . nor can i yield , relent , or ... only two synonyms ? oh my god ! i 'm losing my perspicacity !	Lisa Simpson
well , it 's always in the last place you look .	Homer Simpson
so if we were in school this week , what do you think we 'd be learning ?	Lisa Simpson
now for operation strike-make-go-longer .	Bart Simpson
you know , i heard skinner say the teachers will crack any minute .	Bart Simpson
milhouse , i found a hive of killer bees . you wan na go throw rocks at it ?	Bart Simpson
huh ?	Bart Simpson
wuh ?	Bart Simpson
juh ?	Bart Simpson
what do you mean the bank is out of money ? insolvent ? ! you only have enough cash for the next three customers ? !	Bart Simpson
grade me ! look at me ! evaluate and rank me ! oh -- i 'm good , good , good , and oh so smart ! grade me !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm worried about the kids , homie . lisa 's becoming very obsessive . this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat .	Marge Simpson
i know . and this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke . it just keeps going faster and faster .	Homer Simpson
and bart is n't doing very well either . he needs boundaries , and structure . there 's something about flying a kite at night that 's so unwholesome .	Marge Simpson
hello , mother dear .	Bart Simpson
that 's it . we have to get them back to school .	Marge Simpson
in my weaker moments i almost pity them . then i just remind myself they 're trying to teach .	Bart Simpson
hello class . hi bart . over here , sweetie . it 's me , mom . hi . hey . hello .	Marge Simpson
well , i 'm sure some of you already know me . i 'm bart simpson 's mother .	Marge Simpson
mo-om .	Bart Simpson
may i ?	Bart Simpson
thank you .	Marge Simpson
ohh ... kids have been doing that one since my day .	Marge Simpson
so , how was everybody 's day at school ?	Homer Simpson
horrifying .	Bart Simpson
pointless .	Lisa Simpson
exhausting . it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map .	Marge Simpson
marge , anyone can miss canada ... all tucked away down there .	Homer Simpson
mrs. krabappel , i 'm done failing the test . can i please go to the nurse ?	Bart Simpson
well , my teacher 's a nightmare . three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes , he confiscated everything made of tin , and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener .	Lisa Simpson
there 's no way i 'll get into an ivy league school now . at this rate i probably wo n't even get into vassar .	Lisa Simpson
well , i 've had just about enough of your vassar bashing young lady .	Homer Simpson
look mom , it feels really weird having you on my turf . how would you feel if i started moppin ' the floor ?	Bart Simpson
i 'd be thrilled . you can start right now .	Marge Simpson
and i 'm gon na keep teaching your class . like it or lump it .	Marge Simpson
well , then . i guess i 'll just have to get into the crawl space again .	Bart Simpson
i hate it when he gets in there .	Marge Simpson
psst . over here .	Bart Simpson
mom , i need a dollar . ever since you started teaching here , kids have been taking my lunch money . and i need that money for candy .	Bart Simpson
ah , here you go , precious . now go off with your friends .	Marge Simpson
why is n't my mom stopping this ?	Bart Simpson
that 's a very nice jig , kearney . now , is n't dancing much more fun than bullying ?	Marge Simpson
that 's it . i ca n't take this anymore , milhouse . i 've got ta get the real teachers back .	Bart Simpson
oh , this is wonderful ! you 're alive !	Homer Simpson
zuh ? wait , that 's it ! with your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts , we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together .	Bart Simpson
... and you 're not coming out until you reach an agreement .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , they 'll start negotiating .	Bart Simpson
i 'm listening ...	Bart Simpson
no thanks to you , homer .	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm surprised he does n't try to blame his problems on his percodan addiction .	Bart Simpson
bart , are you ready for your history test ?	Marge Simpson
oh you bet , mom . ask me anything .	Bart Simpson
ok. who was george washington carver ?	Marge Simpson
um , the guy who chopped up george washington ?	Bart Simpson
really ? wow .	Homer Simpson
bart , you said you were going to study .	Marge Simpson
oh , my stomach !	Bart Simpson
you just do n't want to take that test .	Marge Simpson
no i mean it . it really hurts !	Bart Simpson
mom , i think he 's serious .	Lisa Simpson
kids are so naã¯ve . lisa , when you get to be our age , you 'll learn a few things , like when a sign says `` do not feed the bears , '' man , you 'd better not feed the bears .	Homer Simpson
now get to school , boy .	Homer Simpson
mrs. krabappel , i ca n't take the test . i have a stomach ache .	Bart Simpson
look , if you ignore me and i die , you 'd get in a lot of trouble .	Bart Simpson
no teacher shall be held accountable if bart simpson dies .	Bart Simpson
lunchlady doris ! why are you here ?	Bart Simpson
look , my stomach really hurts .	Bart Simpson
man , these are primo seats . i could really go for a hot dog .	Homer Simpson
homer , this is an operation !	Marge Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
how 's my special little guy ?	Marge Simpson
how 're you feelin ' , big brother ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , right .	Homer Simpson
wicked . i got this cool scar and i get to miss a week of school .	Bart Simpson
i 'm glad you 're okay , bart .	Lisa Simpson
bleeding gums murphy !	Lisa Simpson
it 's been a long time .	Lisa Simpson
ew . how 'd you get a name like that ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah .	Lisa Simpson
my brother just had his appendix out .	Lisa Simpson
hello , i 'm dr. cheeks . i 'm doing my rounds and uh , i 'm a little behind .	Bart Simpson
he 'll be fine .	Lisa Simpson
what about your family ?	Lisa Simpson
it must be awful to be all alone in the world .	Lisa Simpson
when was the last time you worked ?	Lisa Simpson
your sax ! thank you so much !	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
wow , you 've had some career . although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely .	Lisa Simpson
i sure am . look !	Lisa Simpson
i stopped brushing my teeth so i can play just like you !	Lisa Simpson
lift me , wo n't you lift me / above the old routine / make it nice , play it clean , jazzman ...	Lisa Simpson
when the jazzman 's testi-fyin ' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman , oh jazzman ...	Lisa Simpson
marge !	Marge Simpson
hey , bleeding gums ! i was great ! and i owe it all to ...	Lisa Simpson
what happened to mr. murphy ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , honey , are you gon na be okay ?	Homer Simpson
bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt .	Lisa Simpson
oh i 'm sure he knew . and i 'm sure that wherever he is now , he 's happy .	Homer Simpson
but he was the only person who had the same love for music that i do .	Lisa Simpson
thank you . oh dad , why did he have to die ?	Lisa Simpson
well , it 's like the time that your cat , snowball , got run over .	Homer Simpson
uh huh .	Lisa Simpson
remember , honey ?	Homer Simpson
yeah .	Lisa Simpson
what i 'm saying is , all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman .	Homer Simpson
oh , dad !	Lisa Simpson
i blew it again .	Homer Simpson
mmmmmm .	Homer Simpson
hey , lisa . are you still upset about that jazz guy ?	Bart Simpson
if it helps , i believe that after you die , you can come back as whatever you want . i 'll be a butterfly .	Bart Simpson
how come ?	Lisa Simpson
because nobody ever suspects the butterfly .	Bart Simpson
uh , maybe i need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom .	Lisa Simpson
grampa !	Lisa Simpson
it 's only maggie .	Lisa Simpson
that 's only the cat .	Lisa Simpson
that 's maggie again , grampa .	Lisa Simpson
how come it wo n't stop hurting ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , it 's normal to be sad when a friend dies , and bleeding gums was a good friend to you . but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them .	Marge Simpson
lisa , honey , if you really want to preserve his memory , i recommend getting a tattoo . it preserves the things you love .	Homer Simpson
starland vocal band ? ! they suck !	Homer Simpson
is n't anybody gon na show up ?	Lisa Simpson
no ! it was bleeding gums murphy .	Lisa Simpson
saxophone ! he was a jazz musician .	Lisa Simpson
you did n't know him ! nobody knew him ! but he was a great man ! and i wo n't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy !	Lisa Simpson
and i wo n't rest until i 've gotten a hot dog .	Homer Simpson
homer , this is a cemetery .	Marge Simpson
what do you do , follow my husband around ?	Marge Simpson
what kind of legal fees ?	Bart Simpson
how much of the hundred thou do i get ?	Bart Simpson
five hundred dollars !	Bart Simpson

i ca n't believe it ! five hundred bucks ! just think what i can do with that money !	Bart Simpson
five hundred dollars on red .	Bart Simpson
cool .	Bart Simpson
mom , i want to honor bleeding gums ' memory , but i do n't know where to start .	Lisa Simpson
hm , maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him .	Marge Simpson
jazz . they just make it up as they go along . i could do that . dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee .	Homer Simpson
that 's mary had a little lamb .	Marge Simpson

i 'll take it !	Bart Simpson
lisa , look what i 've got !	Bart Simpson
ta-daa !	Bart Simpson
bart ! i ca n't believe it ... but why ?	Lisa Simpson
when i said my stomach hurt , you were the only one who believed me .	Bart Simpson
oh thank you . but five hundred dollars ! you 'll never see that much money again !	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah ? take a look at this :	Bart Simpson
i got the album !	Lisa Simpson
i did the best i could , bleeding gums .	Lisa Simpson
that was for you , bleeding gums .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't want you to go !	Lisa Simpson
good-bye .	Lisa Simpson

when the jazzman 's testi-fyin ' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman , take my blues away ...	Lisa Simpson
one more time !	Lisa Simpson
are n't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture ?	Marge Simpson
they 're butchering the classics . could that bassoon have come in any more late ?	Homer Simpson
ah , c'mon , homer , there 's lasers . you like lasers .	Marge Simpson
laser effects , mirrored balls . john williams must be rolling around in his grave .	Homer Simpson
we 're outta here !	Homer Simpson
whoa , careful now . these are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types ... so avoid eye contact , watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! easy money !	Homer Simpson
homie , these games are fixed .	Marge Simpson
then how come that guy 's winning ?	Homer Simpson
he looks and acts just like the dealer . i think they 're related or at least in cahoots .	Marge Simpson
twenty on this one , my good man .	Homer Simpson
homer , he cheated you .	Marge Simpson
it 's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas . how dare you prey on the greedy and stupid , like this .	Marge Simpson
somebody stop him !	Marge Simpson
he 's getting away ! ! c'mon ! c'mon !	Marge Simpson
no marge ! !	Homer Simpson
uh , i must warn you , um , uh , sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline . wee-aah !	Marge Simpson
see ? ...	Marge Simpson
ah , i think i 'm okay . it was scary , but , in a weird way , it was also kind of exhilarating .	Marge Simpson
yes , it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman .	Homer Simpson
oh for crying out loud ...	Marge Simpson
easy now , sweetheart . homie 's here .	Homer Simpson
hey mom , is this how you caught him ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , please , you 're too puny to --	Bart Simpson
lisa , unhand your brother .	Marge Simpson
yeah , like that really hurt .	Bart Simpson
mom , was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you 've ever done ?	Lisa Simpson
well , it was pretty exciting , but celery soup 's pretty exciting too .	Marge Simpson
strange , regular ham does n't thrill me anymore . i 'm crossing over to deviled ham . whoa !	Marge Simpson
thanks benevenstanciano .	Marge Simpson
death sports .	Marge Simpson
excuse me ...	Marge Simpson
actually , i 'm interested in becoming a police officer .	Marge Simpson
you did what ? ! !	Homer Simpson
i borrowed your nail clipper , what 's the big deal ?	Bart Simpson
nothing . i 'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop .	Homer Simpson
cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions ?	Bart Simpson
you got it , little buddy .	Marge Simpson
marge , you being a cop makes you the man , which makes me the woman . and i have no interest in that , besides occasionally wearing the underwear , which , as we discussed , is strictly a comfort thing .	Homer Simpson
homer , there 's no reason for you to feel threatened . you 'll always be the man of this house .	Marge Simpson
aw , thanks , honey .	Homer Simpson
hey everybody , mom 's home .	Marge Simpson
they did n't have my size shirt , but you get the idea .	Marge Simpson
wow , mom , i never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before .	Bart Simpson
marge , i want you to take care of yourself out there . you 've become very dear to me .	Homer Simpson
oh , homie , of course i will .	Marge Simpson
mom , if someone shot at the mayor , would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet ?	Lisa Simpson
i suppose i would .	Marge Simpson
what if they shot at a coke machine ?	Bart Simpson
no .	Marge Simpson
tv ?	Bart Simpson
no .	Marge Simpson
tv with a picture of the mayor on it ?	Bart Simpson
whatever you do , mom , we 'll be proud of you .	Lisa Simpson
well , thank you , honey .	Marge Simpson
as long as it 's constitutional .	Lisa Simpson
homer , give me my pepper spray .	Marge Simpson
oh marge , one squirt and you 're south of the border .	Homer Simpson
mmm . incapacitating .	Homer Simpson
hello , mr. hutz .	Marge Simpson
i just wanted to say hello .	Marge Simpson
two hundred . no ! no ! i mean , i mean nothing . i do n't take bribes .	Marge Simpson
apu , no .	Marge Simpson
that 's better .	Marge Simpson
i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address .	Marge Simpson
um-hmmm . who called the police ?	Marge Simpson
look , why do n't you two settle down . i 'm sure you can get another pillow .	Marge Simpson
so , mom , what are you gon na do with your day off ?	Lisa Simpson
i just want to relax and forget that i 'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .	Marge Simpson
bart , it 's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet .	Marge Simpson
but mom --	Bart Simpson
it 's for your own safety .	Marge Simpson
ugh !	Bart Simpson
do n't stop talking on account of me . i may be a cop , but i 'm still your friend .	Marge Simpson
so , how are you , mrs. krabappel ?	Marge Simpson
moe , i 've never seen you here before .	Marge Simpson
you do n't have to call me `` officer . '' i 'm not on duty here .	Marge Simpson
whoa !	Marge Simpson
oh . uh , a looks nice . it 's a , it 's a good length for you .	Marge Simpson
mom 's police tape is n't a toy , dad .	Lisa Simpson
shush , dear , you 'll wreck daddy 's fun .	Homer Simpson
. fooled you flanders . made you think your family was dead . didja get it ? they 're not , though .	Homer Simpson
but you thought they were .	Homer Simpson
and that 's the drunk tank , and this is mommy 's desk .	Marge Simpson
mom , i know your intentions are good , but are n't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites ? do n't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons ?	Lisa Simpson
look , lisa . it 's mcgriff the crime dog .	Marge Simpson
hello , lisa . help me bite crime . ruff , ruff .	Marge Simpson
`` the girls of the internet . '' ooh , i 'd go on line with them any day .	Homer Simpson
hey , hurry it up with the cards , lenny . i 've got you clocked at two miles per hour .	Homer Simpson
all the more reason to hurry up . hey , what could be going a hundred miles per --	Homer Simpson
illegal gambling in my house ? !	Marge Simpson
marge , you chased away all my poker buddies .	Homer Simpson
i did n't mean to .	Marge Simpson
oh , you 've become such a cop ! and , not that long ago , you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots , a sewer of buttons , an unplugger of hairy clogs .	Homer Simpson
i 'm still all those things . only now i 'm cleaning up the city , sewing together the social fabric , and unplugging the clogs of our legal system .	Marge Simpson
you 're cooking what for dinner ?	Homer Simpson
everywhere i look , someone is breaking the law . dog , no leash . man littering . horse not wearing diaper . car parked across three handicapped spaces ...	Marge Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
hey , marge . how 's my little piglet ?	Homer Simpson
homer , i 'm on duty .	Marge Simpson
that 's okay . i 'm supposed to be workin ' , too .	Homer Simpson
you have to move your car .	Marge Simpson
i 'll just be a second , marge . i 'm going to get some beer for those kids over there .	Homer Simpson
i 'm gon na pretend i did n't hear that , but you have to move your car now .	Marge Simpson
i 'll be right back . now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop .	Homer Simpson
oh , that 's it . i 'm gon na write you a ticket .	Marge Simpson
c'mon , we 're family .	Homer Simpson
you 're breaking the law .	Marge Simpson
i 'll make you a deal . you rip up that ticket , and i 'll give you back your hat . wuh , wuh , wuh ! hee , hee-hee !	Homer Simpson
homer , taking an officer 's cap is an arrestable offense .	Marge Simpson
what 're you gon na do about it ? what 're you gon na do ? ooh , i 'm officer marge , i 'm gon na arrest you ! whoa ! etc .	Homer Simpson
whuh ! marge , not here . hey , you 're not really arresting me ... ?	Homer Simpson
you have the right to remain silent ...	Marge Simpson
i choose to waive that right .	Homer Simpson
lem me just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry i had to arrest you , homer . but what i did was right . someday , when you really need it , you 'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there .	Marge Simpson
i have nothing more to say to you , marge . i 'm drawing a line down the center of the house ã la `` i love lucy '' -- you stay on your side and i 'll stay on my side .	Homer Simpson
boy , when marge first told me she was going to the police academy , i thought it 'd be fun and exciting , you know , like that movie , `` spaceballs . '' but instead , it 's been painful and disturbing , like that movie `` police academy . ''	Homer Simpson
all right guys , pipe down . i 've got some more in the garage .	Homer Simpson
hmm ... i wonder why he 's so eager to go to the garage .	Homer Simpson
well , what do you call it ?	Homer Simpson
hey herman , i had to come out here to see what 's so funny - a counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole ! i 'm gon na tell everyone ! wait here .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
herman , how could you ? we 've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another , but what about the victims ? hard working designers , like calvin klein , gloria vanderbilt , or antoine bugle boy . these are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said , `` me too . ''	Homer Simpson
i do n't think that 's a very good idea .	Marge Simpson
no , it 's officer simpson - of the police !	Marge Simpson
herman , your beef is with me . leave the girl out of this .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
it 's too late for me , marge ! sell the jeans and live like a queen .	Homer Simpson
marge !	Homer Simpson
bust 'im , mom ! / get 'im , mom ! / nail 'im ! / you can do it !	Lisa Simpson
go back to bed ! do n't make me come up there !	Marge Simpson

oh , marge . you saved my life ! i 'm sorry i teased you . you 're a really good cop . i 'm proud of you .	Homer Simpson
he 's gettin ' away ! you blew it , marge !	Homer Simpson
i do n't think so .	Marge Simpson
marge , how did you know ...	Homer Simpson
that the pants would rip ? ...	Marge Simpson
no , what i was wondering is ...	Homer Simpson
years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching , which these jeans have in spades .	Marge Simpson
yes there is , there 's a garage full of counterfeit jeans .	Homer Simpson
that 's it ! there 's too much corruption on this force . i quit !	Marge Simpson
wet cement ! is there any sweeter sign ? well , maybe `` high voltage . ''	Bart Simpson
no time .	Bart Simpson
this is for the ages .	Bart Simpson
ay caramba !	Bart Simpson
aah . oh , good , somebody 's shadow . i 'll just turn and brag about my work .	Bart Simpson
bart , you 've graffito-tagged public property .	Marge Simpson
it was an accident .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe you vandalized your own home town , bart . what would jebediah springfield say ?	Marge Simpson
i think he 'd be cool with it .	Bart Simpson
oh , homer , would you please help me make a big deal of this ?	Marge Simpson
what for ? nobody cared when bogart defaced that sidewalk in hollywood .	Homer Simpson
well , i am just shocked by this whole family . whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride ?	Marge Simpson
it 's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire .	Lisa Simpson
now just a darned minute ! this town is a part of who you are .	Marge Simpson
this is a springfield isotopes cap . when you wear it , you 're wearing springfield . when you eat a fish from our river , you 're eating springfield . when you make lemonade from our trees you 're drinking springfield .	Marge Simpson
mom , when you give that lecture , you 're boring springfield .	Bart Simpson
bart , you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it . this town is a part of us all , a part of us all , a part of us all . sorry to repeat myself but it 'll help you remember .	Marge Simpson
this town is a part of us all ... a part of us all ... a part of us all ...	Marge Simpson
wow , that does work .	Bart Simpson
hey , gon na win some this season ?	Bart Simpson

i do n't even want any . i just bought a pity glass ...	Lisa Simpson
you know milhouse , i 've been thinking . this town ai n't so bad . good friends , lots of lemons , numerous angel sightings -- when you get right down to it , springfield 's a pretty cool place to live .	Bart Simpson
hey , stop talking bad about my town , man .	Bart Simpson
i do n't make trash , i burn it .	Bart Simpson
well , i know you are , but what am i ?	Bart Simpson
oh , i know you are , but what am i ?	Bart Simpson
i know you are , but what am i ?	Bart Simpson
takes one to know one .	Bart Simpson
that 's a crud rock . it belongs in crud town .	Bart Simpson
hey ! they 're taking our lemons !	Bart Simpson
those shelbyville kids think they 're so hot . but you know what ? they 're not .	Bart Simpson
the lemon tree 's gone !	Bart Simpson
we got ta get that tree back !	Bart Simpson
that lemon tree 's a part of our town , and as kids , the backbone of our economy . we 'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead .	Bart Simpson
where you going , bart ?	Marge Simpson
mom , you wo n't believe this , but something you said the other day really got through to me .	Bart Simpson
and now i am going to teach some kids a lesson .	Bart Simpson
i choose to take that literally .	Marge Simpson
death to shelbyville !	Bart Simpson
yes , bart 's a tutor now . tute on , son ! tute on !	Homer Simpson
hey , milhouse -- get your invasion supplies and let 's go !	Bart Simpson
okay , here 's how it goes . i 'm the leader . milhouse is my loyal sidekick . nelson is the tough guy , martin 's the smart guy and todd 's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin ' crazy . and now , the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger . to step out of childhood and become men .	Bart Simpson
if you get lost remember , you can always find east by staring directly at the sun .	Bart Simpson
they 're gettin ' rich off us !	Bart Simpson
it 's almost lunch time . do you know where your brother is tutoring ?	Marge Simpson
tutoring ? the only thing bart 's teaching is guerilla combat in shelbyville .	Lisa Simpson
well , do you have a number where we can reach him ?	Marge Simpson
no , mom ! bart and some kids ran off to wage war on shelbyville .	Lisa Simpson
homer , come quick ! bart 's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang !	Marge Simpson
good idea . milhouse , you and me will be omega team . todd , you and data are team strike force . nelson , that leaves you and martin .	Bart Simpson
this is my fault . i tried to teach bart about town pride , but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness .	Marge Simpson
now , marge , you ca n't blame all of bart 's problems on your one little speech . if anything turned him bad , it 's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear . and let 's not forget your little speech ...	Homer Simpson
is n't there anything we can do ?	Marge Simpson
yes , there is . come on , everybody , let 's go into shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves ! i got an r.v . we can use ... flanders 's !	Homer Simpson
pile in , everybody ! no time to wipe your feet !	Homer Simpson
i 'm not sure .	Bart Simpson
i assumed i could .	Bart Simpson
aw . it 's no use , milhouse . if we 're gon na find that lemon tree , i 've got to go undercover . what i need is a new face .	Bart Simpson
hello there , fellow shelbyvillians .	Bart Simpson
i do n't go to school .	Bart Simpson
five .	Bart Simpson
curse those handsome devils .	Bart Simpson
no , not in my mouth ! aye -- is what the kid would say . to the bluffs !	Bart Simpson
that 's right . the stranger who walks amongst you is me , bart simpson !	Bart Simpson
you know , bart simpson . from springfield ?	Bart Simpson
i 'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety . so long , losers !	Bart Simpson
uh ... hey , look ! someone 's attractive cousin .	Bart Simpson
uh oh , wet cement !	Bart Simpson
i could sure use that flying motorcycle now .	Bart Simpson
safe at last !	Bart Simpson
caution : exit through door seven only . all other rooms contain man-eating tigers .	Bart Simpson
roman numerals . they never even tried to teach us that in school .	Bart Simpson
milhouse ! what 's seven in roman numerals ?	Bart Simpson
milhouse ! milhouse ! now what do i do ?	Bart Simpson
wait ! i got it ! i got it !	Bart Simpson
i do n't got it .	Bart Simpson
okay . think , bart . where have you seen roman numerals before ? i know , `` rocky vee ! '' that was the fifth one . so `` rocky five '' plus `` rocky two '' equals `` rocky seven : adrian 's revenge ! ''	Bart Simpson
oh , it 's no use . i 'm never gon na find that tree . this whole raid was as useless as that yellow , lemon-shaped rock over there . wait a minute ! there 's a lemon behind that rock .	Bart Simpson
the tree !	Bart Simpson
keep your voices down , boys . we did n't come this far to get found out .	Bart Simpson
found 'em !	Homer Simpson
you kids are in big trouble , running away from home like this .	Homer Simpson
but they stole our lemon tree !	Bart Simpson
i do n't care what excuse you 've got , nothing 's gon na stop me in the middle of this speech , you 're gon na -- lemon tree ? ! !	Homer Simpson
that tree 's been in springfield since the time of our forefathers . give it back or we 'll bust in there and take it !	Homer Simpson
stupider like a fox !	Homer Simpson
i 'm okay .	Homer Simpson
this is the darkest day in the history of springfield . if anybody wants me , i 'll be in the shower .	Homer Simpson
there 's got to be a way to get that tree back . hey , look . a hospital ! pull in there .	Bart Simpson
oh , great . now i 'm upside-down .	Homer Simpson
no one in history has ever done anything this clever .	Homer Simpson
i 'll get the gate .	Bart Simpson
that 's okay , son . i 'll take care of him .	Homer Simpson
faster , son -- he 's got a taste for meat now !	Homer Simpson
gun it , flanders !	Bart Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson
we made it !	Bart Simpson
woo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
eat my shorts , shelbyville !	Bart Simpson
eat my shorrrrrrrts !	Bart Simpson
absolutely .	Bart Simpson
yuck . what reeks ?	Bart Simpson
here 's your package , mr. burns !	Homer Simpson
-- son !	Homer Simpson
i 'd like to start a jazz program for the music department . we 've got a really great instructor lined up ...	Lisa Simpson
he 's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job .	Lisa Simpson
let 's go now , mr. puente .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm happy for the school . it sounds like this money is gon na provide a lot of new opportunities .	Marge Simpson
big deal . they did n't approve my idea . they said it was `` unfeasible . ''	Bart Simpson
it is unfeasible to resurrect the dead , bart . and even if the three stooges were alive , i doubt they 'd want to hang around with you .	Lisa Simpson
well , um , yeah . i guess they 'd probably want to be with their families or something , huh ?	Bart Simpson
i hate my job . i mean , what 's the point when your boss does n't even remember your name ?	Homer Simpson
i have an idea .	Marge Simpson
what ? what 's your idea ?	Homer Simpson
when my father was first trying to catch my mother 's eye , he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it . after that , she never forgot him .	Marge Simpson
that 's all well and good , but it 's not really your idea , is it now marge ?	Homer Simpson
huh ? wahw !	Bart Simpson
holy christmas .	Marge Simpson
i 'll get even with whoever did this to you , boy . i swear it .	Bart Simpson
oh , no . that 's awful , mr. puente . what ? oh . he owns the nuclear power plant . yeah , i 'd like to settle his hash , too .	Lisa Simpson
dad , how can you work for a man like mr. burns ?	Lisa Simpson
well , he 's not all bad . he did send me this nice thank-you card .	Homer Simpson
`` marge , bart , lisa , and maggie . '' dad , this does n't have your name on it .	Lisa Simpson
kids , would you step outside for a second ?	Homer Simpson
f-f-f-f-f-f-	Homer Simpson
i must say mr. burns is being awfully inconsiderate . selfish , even .	Marge Simpson
burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo . right , dad ? dad ? homer ?	Bart Simpson
sorry , grampa . it 's just that , for a second , it looked like dad had melted .	Lisa Simpson
strained carrots for maggie ... strained carrots for grampa .	Marge Simpson
stop it , stop it , stop it ! stop it !	Homer Simpson
what ?	Homer Simpson
homer simpson ! homer simpson ! shut up ! homer simpson ! my name is homer simpson !	Homer Simpson
oh , you 're a dead man ! oh , you 're dead ! you 're dead burns !	Homer Simpson
that 's my dog , man .	Bart Simpson
wow !	Bart Simpson
bart ! put that down ! guns are very dangerous , and i wo n't have them in this house .	Marge Simpson
i 'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands ca n't get to it .	Marge Simpson
he robbed the school of music !	Lisa Simpson
he ca n't remember my name !	Homer Simpson
he 's causing us all to yell !	Marge Simpson
look what he did to my best friend !	Bart Simpson
no , my dog !	Bart Simpson
you twisted old monster ! !	Bart Simpson
that 's odd . where 's homer ? and bart ? and lisa ? and grampa ?	Marge Simpson
where is everybody ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't think we 'll ever know who did this . everyone in town 's a suspect .	Marge Simpson
everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns . even us .	Lisa Simpson
bart , he broke your dog 's legs . grampa , he destroyed your home . and dad , well , you kind of went berserk when he could n't remember your name .	Lisa Simpson
berserk is right ! ! may i have some iced tea , please ?	Homer Simpson
are n't we forgetting someone , sister suspect ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , i was just getting to me . because of mr. burns , they canceled my jazz program , and my friend tito puente got fired . but i could never shoot someone .	Lisa Simpson
could so !	Bart Simpson
could not !	Lisa Simpson
could so !	Bart Simpson
could not !	Lisa Simpson
could so !	Bart Simpson
could not !	Lisa Simpson
could so !	Bart Simpson
could not !	Lisa Simpson
kids ! kids ! kids ! as far as daddy 's concerned , you 're both potential murderers .	Homer Simpson
the police already have a suspect . it 's mr. smithers .	Marge Simpson
we do n't have an outhouse .	Lisa Simpson
my tool shed ! oh dad !	Homer Simpson
sure ! i 've had it up to here with these damn rickets !	Homer Simpson
i guess it 's never the most likely suspect .	Marge Simpson
look at burns ' suit . yeesh .	Lisa Simpson
actually , mom , in 95 % of cases , it is . the rest of the time , it 's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason .	Lisa Simpson
hey , i had a damn good reason . he could never remember my name ...	Homer Simpson
homer simpson ! homer simpson !	Homer Simpson
well , i do n't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder .	Lisa Simpson
nancy drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends . and i 've got an inquisitive temperament ! maybe i could help solve this !	Lisa Simpson
i think you 're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder . why do n't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer ?	Marge Simpson
who wants chocolate ice cream ?	Bart Simpson
me ! me ! me , me !	Homer Simpson
mr. burns is the richest man in town . maybe it was about money .	Lisa Simpson
hey ! i said that . my name is lisa simpson , and i made a chart of all the suspects in the burns case . look .	Lisa Simpson
tito puente ?	Lisa Simpson
well , he did vow revenge . but i ca n't see him doing something illegal -- he 's in show business ! he 's a celebrit --	Lisa Simpson
grampa , i found your cigar box dug up in the backyard , but the gun was n't there . have you seen it ?	Marge Simpson
i was just asking if you 'd seen it . there 's no need to be a prickly pear .	Marge Simpson
were you talking to me , grampa ?	Marge Simpson
chief wig-gum ... do n't eat ... the clues .	Lisa Simpson
this suit burns better . look .	Lisa Simpson
better ... look ... burns ... suit .	Lisa Simpson
burns ' suit ! burns ' suit !	Lisa Simpson
hey , chief wiggum , what are you doing ? what 's going on ?	Lisa Simpson
d.n.a. , positive i.d . -- those wo n't hold up in any court -- run , dad !	Bart Simpson
i swear , i 've never seen that gun before .	Homer Simpson
the police have such a strong case against homer . mr. burns said he did it , they have homer 's d.n.a ...	Marge Simpson
they have simpson d.n.a . it could 've come from any of us . except you , since you 're a bouvier .	Lisa Simpson
no . no , no . when i took your father 's name , i took everything that came with it , including d.n.a .	Marge Simpson
okay , mom . anyway , my point is , the evidence is n't as concrete as it seems . like those fingerprints . they could 've gotten on the gun some other way .	Lisa Simpson
are you sure you do n't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , right . you chose fruit , you live with fruit .	Homer Simpson
no . no . no . ewww . why is this on the floor ?	Homer Simpson
and we do n't even know whose gun that was . maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad .	Lisa Simpson
no . we ca n't start thinking that way about our own family members . suspicion could tear us apart .	Marge Simpson
so you finally learned my name , eh ?	Homer Simpson
i 've got no time for your demented parlor games ! you wo n't be telling anyone else that homer simpson shot you .	Homer Simpson
the scene of the crime ! there must be something here that can clear dad .	Lisa Simpson
that 's it ! oh , mr. pigeon , i 'd kiss you if you were n't swimming with disease .	Lisa Simpson
so , the d.n.a . was right . it must 've been ... oh , dad !	Lisa Simpson
stop ! do n't shoot my dad ! he 's innocent . he would n't hurt a fly !	Lisa Simpson
stop telling them it was me . i 'll kill you for saying it was me .	Homer Simpson
say it burns . say i never shot you ... before .	Homer Simpson
then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to w and s .	Lisa Simpson
or from your point of view , m and s ... maggie simpson .	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm just relieved that homer 's safe and you 've recovered and we can all get back to normal . if maggie could talk i 'm sure she 'd apologize for shooting you .	Marge Simpson
besides , she did n't mean it . it was an accident .	Marge Simpson
aw , all these new superheroes suck . none of them can hold a candle to radioactive man .	Bart Simpson
nah , he 's just a cheap imitation of radioactive man .	Bart Simpson
the similarities are subtle , but many . for example , radioactive man has his famous catchphrase `` up and atom '' - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun ...	Bart Simpson
... while radiation dude has a similar , but lamer catchphrase : `` up and let 's go . ''	Bart Simpson
well , between us we 've read all 814 issues of radioactive man .	Bart Simpson
who 's gon na play radioactive man ?	Bart Simpson
look behind you , radioactive man ! the sun is exploding again !	Bart Simpson
bart , why are you talking like that ?	Marge Simpson
yeah . and who the hell are you talkin ' to ? marge , do you have other men in this house ? radioactive men ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm practicing my fallout boy dialogue . if i get this role , i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart .	Bart Simpson
which one were you ? the ugly one ?	Homer Simpson
were you the ugly one ?	Homer Simpson
watch out !	Bart Simpson
... radioactive man ! ! !	Bart Simpson
thank you , thank you , thank you . it 's all in the delivery . ... now is the winter of our discontent ...	Bart Simpson
watch out , radioactive man ! ! ! ! !	Bart Simpson
watch out , radioactive man ! ! ! ! !	Bart Simpson
watch out , radioactive man ! ! ! ! !	Bart Simpson
i 've got to grow an inch by tomorrow or i wo n't get that part . pull , you mighty stallions , pull . show me no mercy .	Bart Simpson
i only grew half an inch . i 'm still too short .	Bart Simpson
growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good , bart .	Marge Simpson
yeah , that 's how fast grampa is shrinking .	Lisa Simpson
is there anyway i can look taller without actually being taller ?	Bart Simpson
good news , gentlemen . i 've grown that extra inch you wanted , plus several feet more .	Bart Simpson
hey , you 're not milhouse .	Bart Simpson
i just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life . george burns was right -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess .	Bart Simpson
cheer up , bart . milhouse is still gon na need a true friend . someone to tell him he 's great , someone to rub lotion on him , someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he 's feeling low .	Lisa Simpson
you 're right , lis . i can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to god .	Bart Simpson
guess what , kids . they 're gon na pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here .	Homer Simpson
careful now .	Homer Simpson
hey , did n't you direct `` unnatural discretion '' ?	Homer Simpson
hooey ! whew , oh . you know , i never walk out of a movie , but eech !	Homer Simpson
hi , milhouse . hey , i want you to know that i 'm glad at least one of us got the part .	Bart Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
i did n't do it ! i wished him well ! i wished him weeelll !	Bart Simpson
there 's the real milhouse .	Bart Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
hey , cool , milhouse ! you get to be crushed by a truck !	Bart Simpson
you guys work on the movie ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i always wanted to be a teamster . so lazy and surly . mind if i relax next to you ?	Homer Simpson
wow . you really got it made now , milhouse . this is living .	Bart Simpson
yes .	Bart Simpson
yeah . ahhh !	Bart Simpson
i know milhouse . i 'll just check all his old haunts .	Bart Simpson
have you seen milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
yo , doctor s. have you seen milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
okay , thanks .	Bart Simpson
i will .	Bart Simpson
the only place left is the treehouse .	Bart Simpson
ah-ha !	Bart Simpson
but milhouse , being a star is every patriotic american 's dream .	Bart Simpson
television .	Bart Simpson
but milhouse ! they have n't cured anything . heart disease and world hunger are still rampant . those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers . every last one of them . want results ? you have to go to the schwarzeneggers , the stallones , and , to a lesser extent , the van dammes .	Bart Simpson
wow , spanning two decades .	Bart Simpson
so , milhouse , it must be a little tough givin ' up all that glamour comin ' back to school , huh .	Bart Simpson
here 's your toast , maggie . i melba-fied it myself .	Marge Simpson
oh , lisa , honey , i tracked down those old newspapers for your history project .	Marge Simpson
wow , mom . you did n't have to go to this much trouble .	Lisa Simpson
oh , it was no trouble . the hobos at the dump were very helpful . except one man who seemed to have mental problems .	Marge Simpson
g'mornin ' .	Bart Simpson
bart , it 's class photo day . no dracula fangs .	Marge Simpson
but they told us to wear 'em .	Bart Simpson
no they did n't .	Marge Simpson
and do n't put signs on your sister .	Marge Simpson
now , keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. that way , the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry ! eh ? eh ?	Marge Simpson
mom , you fuss over us way too much .	Lisa Simpson
enjoy it now , because when you 're a grown up , you 'll have to take care of yourself .	Marge Simpson
marge , there 's a spider near my car keys .	Homer Simpson
you did the right thing by telling me .	Marge Simpson
shoo ! get outta here !	Marge Simpson
ahhh , that 's better . now that we 're alone , papa bear has a li ' l honey for his mama bear .	Homer Simpson
`` good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa . '' mineral bath , facial , massage ... how did you afford these ?	Marge Simpson
oh , never you mind ...	Homer Simpson
what advantages does this motorcar have over , say , a train ? which i could also afford .	Homer Simpson
no we sha n't . yoink !	Homer Simpson
homie , this is so sweet . but i ca n't possibly go now ... the sink is full of dirty dishes , the trash needs to be taken out , the living room is a mess ...	Marge Simpson
oh , we 'll clean up this afternoon .	Homer Simpson
what about maggie ?	Marge Simpson
i got my dad to look after her .	Homer Simpson
do n't do that !	Marge Simpson
c'mon , honey , you work yourself stupid for this family . if anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud , it 's you .	Homer Simpson
well , all right , but i 'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car .	Marge Simpson
hey , how come i get lice and nothing happens to milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
hey , c'mon ! those are prescription shoes ! i need them !	Lisa Simpson
no i do n't !	Lisa Simpson
ow ! mah tug !	Lisa Simpson
printhipal thkinner , i need thum shoes .	Lisa Simpson
this is so relaxing . homie , this was a wonderful idea .	Marge Simpson
yeah . if that mafia guy were n't staring at us , i 'd take off my towel .	Homer Simpson
i do n't know . they should be here .	Lisa Simpson
i love gettin ' away from this dump .	Homer Simpson
it 's like i 'm on some wonderful drug !	Marge Simpson
what 's going on here ?	Marge Simpson
squalid hell hole ... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion ... dogs mating on dining room table ?	Marge Simpson
what are you doing with my children ? !	Marge Simpson
what ? ! no ! you ca n't ! i wo n't let you !	Marge Simpson
uh , please do n't hug me . it sickens me .	Bart Simpson
you do n't understand . mom and dad take good care of us .	Lisa Simpson
that was a baby tooth ... it was loose ...	Lisa Simpson
parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times ...	Marge Simpson
we leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away ? !	Homer Simpson
saxa-ma-phone . saxa-ma-phone .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family . that is so like me .	Marge Simpson
oh , marge , do n't blame yourself . i 'm the terrible parent . the boy bugs the hell outta me , i ca n't help lisa with her homework . the only thing i 'm fit to take care of is a houseplant .	Homer Simpson
lousy houseplant !	Homer Simpson
here you go , todd . the city edition .	Bart Simpson
i hate this place .	Bart Simpson
yeah . it seems like our house , but everything 's got a creepy pat boone-ish quality to it .	Lisa Simpson
watch itchy and scratchy !	Bart Simpson
can you see them ?	Marge Simpson
that 's it . we 're going downtown to get our kids back . right now !	Marge Simpson
we 've always tried to be good parents . please , i 'm begging you , one mother to another -- you must have a family .	Marge Simpson
now wait a minute ! okay , i 'm not gon na win father of the year . in fact , i 'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids . wait , can i start again ? fathering children is the best part of my day ... i 'd do anything for bart and lisa !	Homer Simpson
who ? lady , you got the wrong file .	Homer Simpson
it 's maggie !	Marge Simpson
oh , maggie . i got nothing against maggie .	Homer Simpson
communication . gotcha .	Homer Simpson
listen . yes , i know .	Homer Simpson
i have listening skills !	Homer Simpson
shut up , judge !	Homer Simpson
i never heard maggie laugh like that before .	Bart Simpson
well , when was the last time dad gave her that kind of attention ?	Lisa Simpson
when she swallowed that quarter , he spent all day with her .	Bart Simpson
i thought i could ride this thing out , but everything 's just too weird here .	Lisa Simpson
i know . they put honey on their pancakes instead of maple syrup .	Bart Simpson
and they read newsweek instead of nothing .	Lisa Simpson
... and then i saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice !	Marge Simpson
this is so humiliating .	Marge Simpson
garbage in garbage can . makes sense .	Homer Simpson
but it 's only 7 o'clock .	Bart Simpson
yeah . the sun is still out .	Lisa Simpson
you know , maggie has n't been a simpson as long as us . i think she 's beginning to forget mom and dad .	Lisa Simpson
remember how mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days ?	Bart Simpson
or the way dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips ?	Lisa Simpson
they 're ten feet away and we ca n't even talk to them . i wish i could tell them how much i miss them .	Lisa Simpson
it 's so quiet here without the kids .	Marge Simpson
what i would n't give to hear lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes .	Homer Simpson
i miss the way bart would say something and then say `` dude . ''	Marge Simpson
i wish i knew something about the baby i could miss now .	Homer Simpson
you mean maggie ?	Marge Simpson
that 's it .	Homer Simpson
we 've never been separated from the kids for so long . i do n't know how much more i can take .	Marge Simpson
there 's bart 's ring !	Marge Simpson
todd smells . aw , i already knew that .	Homer Simpson
well , look at the other side .	Marge Simpson
why you cotton pickin ' --	Homer Simpson
no ! i 've got ta pass this class for my kids . son , let 's stop the fussin ' and a-feudin ' .	Homer Simpson
i love you , cletus !	Homer Simpson

oh , my .	Marge Simpson
the only thing i 'm high on is love . love for my son and daughters . yes , a little `` l.s.d . '' is all i need .	Marge Simpson
kids , we 're good parents now ! get your asses out here !	Homer Simpson

the springfield river !	Homer Simpson
son of a bitch ...	Homer Simpson

there was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage , though .	Bart Simpson
old painty-can ned !	Homer Simpson
hymns here ! i got hymns here ! get 'em while they 're holy ! fresh from god 's brain to your mouth !	Bart Simpson
hey , marge , remember when we used to make out to this hymn ?	Homer Simpson
... where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers ...	Bart Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
you shank . how could you tell on me ?	Bart Simpson
soul ? come on , milhouse . there 's no such thing as a soul . it 's just something they made up to scare kids , like the boogeyman or michael jackson .	Bart Simpson
well , if your soul 's real , where is it ?	Bart Simpson
uh huh . what if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean ?	Bart Simpson
how can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid ? listen . you do n't have a soul , i do n't have a soul , there 's no such thing as a soul .	Bart Simpson
how much you got ?	Bart Simpson

there you go : one soul .	Bart Simpson

i 'm not ashamed .	Homer Simpson
oh , li-sa . there 's a little present for you lying in the driveway .	Bart Simpson
oh boy ! really ?	Lisa Simpson
nooooo ! it 's dripping funny-smelling water all over me !	Lisa Simpson
i wasted five bucks on these .	Bart Simpson
where 'd you get five bucks ? i want five bucks .	Lisa Simpson
i sold my soul to milhouse .	Bart Simpson
what ? how could you do that ? your soul is the most valuable part of you !	Lisa Simpson
you believe in that junk ?	Bart Simpson
well , whether or not the soul is physically real , bart , it 's the symbol of everything fine inside us .	Lisa Simpson
poor gullible lisa . i 'll keep my crappy sponges , thanks .	Bart Simpson
bart , your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever . for five dollars , milhouse could own you for a zillion years .	Lisa Simpson
well , if you think he got such a good deal , i 'll sell you my conscience for four-fifty .	Bart Simpson
aw , honey , you 're not a monster .	Marge Simpson
i 'll throw in my sense of decency , too . it 's a bart sales event ! everything about me must go !	Bart Simpson
hey , boy . how ya doin ' ?	Bart Simpson
man , what 's gotten into you ?	Bart Simpson
geez . you 're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day .	Bart Simpson
stupid automatic door .	Bart Simpson
let me try .	Bart Simpson
this is getting weird .	Bart Simpson
how about chairman moe 's magic wok ?	Homer Simpson
i got it ! madman moe 's pressure cooker !	Homer Simpson
forty seconds ? but i want it now .	Homer Simpson
i know that 's funny , but i 'm just not laughing .	Bart Simpson
hmmm ... pablo neruda said laughter is the language of the soul .	Lisa Simpson
i am familiar with the works of pablo neruda .	Bart Simpson
i think we should do a test .	Lisa Simpson
well ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's creepy , bart . i think you really did lose your soul .	Lisa Simpson
nothing .	Bart Simpson
ow ! help me . why is n't anybody , ow , helping me ?	Homer Simpson
hi , is milhouse home ?	Homer Simpson
bet you 're getting tired of that soul , huh ?	Bart Simpson
suppose someone wanted to buy it from you ?	Bart Simpson
what ? !	Bart Simpson

there 's no change in your piggy bank .	Bart Simpson
not in any of the ones you know about .	Lisa Simpson
oh lis , thank you .	Bart Simpson
happy to do it . but you know , bart , some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer , like you did last night .	Lisa Simpson
uh huh .	Bart Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
we 're going to storytown village , grampa . it 's an amusement park for babies .	Lisa Simpson
that 's the plan .	Homer Simpson
i think it 's nice we 're doing something maggie will enjoy for once . besides , i 'm sure storytown village is also fun for everyone ... from 8 , to ... god only knows .	Marge Simpson
what a load of crappy-crap-crap .	Bart Simpson
quiet , boy . i have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down .	Homer Simpson
this is where the wolf blows down the pigs ' house !	Marge Simpson

hey flanders !	Homer Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
so , ned , you 're having a family reunion and you did n't invite me ?	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you did n't invite me after i painted those cool stripes all over your car . i know ! i 'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen ! and i 'll only invite who i want . that 'll show ya .	Homer Simpson
sure .	Homer Simpson
this barbecue will be hard , thankless work , but i 'm sure you 're up to it , marge .	Homer Simpson
well , it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting .	Marge Simpson
you know what you should serve , marge ? more of these lamb chops . these are the best ever .	Homer Simpson
why thank you , homie . you might say the extra ingredient is salt .	Marge Simpson
what 's wrong lisa ? did n't you get enough lamb chops ?	Marge Simpson
i ca n't eat this . i ca n't eat a poor little lamb !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , get a hold of yourself . this is lamb ... not a lamb .	Homer Simpson
what 's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me ?	Lisa Simpson
this one spent two hours in the broiler .	Bart Simpson
bart , sensible bites ! all right lisa . if you do n't want lamb chops , there 's lots of other things i can make : chicken breast , rump roast , hot dogs ...	Marge Simpson

i think lisa 's right , dad . eating meat is ba-a-a-ad .	Bart Simpson
hey , that 's my chop !	Bart Simpson
oh , my family just does n't understand my newfound vegetarianism .	Lisa Simpson
compared to them , the public schools are a haven of enlightenment .	Lisa Simpson
why does it talk like a lamb ?	Lisa Simpson
ah ... miss hoover ? i do n't think i can dissect an animal . i think it 's wrong .	Lisa Simpson
ah , excuse me ? is n't there anything here that does n't have meat in it ?	Lisa Simpson
well i believe you 're required to provide a vegetarian alternative .	Lisa Simpson
do you remember when you lost your passion for this work ?	Lisa Simpson
i never realized before , but some itchy and scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny .	Lisa Simpson
say what ? cartoons do n't have messages , lisa . they 're just a bunch of hilarious stuff , you know , like people getting hurt and stuff . stuff like that .	Bart Simpson
look , kids ! i just got my party invitations back from the printer 's .	Homer Simpson
come to homer 's bbbq . the extra b is for byobb .	Lisa Simpson
what 's that extra b for ?	Bart Simpson
that 's a typo .	Homer Simpson
dad , ca n't you have some other kind of party ? one where you do n't serve meat ?	Lisa Simpson
but all normal people love meat . if i went to a barbecue and there was no meat , i would say , `` yo , goober ! where 's the meat ? '' i 'm trying to impress people here , lisa . you do n't win friends with salad .	Homer Simpson
you do n't win friends with sal-ad / you do n't win friends with sal-ad ...	Bart Simpson
you do n't win friends with sal-ad / you do n't win friends with sal-ad / you do n't win friends with sal-ad / you do n't win friends with sal-ad ...	Bart Simpson
you do n't win friends with sal-ad / you do n't win friends with sal-ad ...	Marge Simpson

marge , since i 'm not talking to lisa , would you please ask her to pass me the syrup ?	Homer Simpson
please pass your father the syrup , lisa .	Marge Simpson
bart , tell dad i 'll only pass the syrup if it wo n't be used on any meat product .	Lisa Simpson
you dunkin ' your sausages in that syrup , homeboy ?	Bart Simpson
marge , tell bart i just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like i do every morning .	Homer Simpson
tell him yourself . you 're ignoring lisa , not bart .	Marge Simpson
bart , thank your mother for pointing that out .	Homer Simpson

i understand , honey . i used to believe in things when i was a kid .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , i 'll give you a piggy-back ride , oops , i mean a veggie-back ride home .	Homer Simpson
ah , the miracle mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there 's not a single church or library to offend the eye . it truly is a miracle .	Homer Simpson

these monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear ! and you kids should have jackets on .	Marge Simpson
hey , what 's that in his footprint ?	Lisa Simpson
hmmmmm .	Lisa Simpson
if your advertising agency created all those giant characters , you must know how to stop them .	Lisa Simpson

but people ca n't help looking at them . they 're wrecking the town .	Lisa Simpson
hey , springfield ! are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis ? then take a tip from mr. paul anka ...	Lisa Simpson

oh my god ! bart , groundskeeper willie was in my nightmare , too ! but he got me with hedge-clippers !	Lisa Simpson
mom , dad -- martin died at school today !	Lisa Simpson
i do n't see what that has to do with groundskeeper willie .	Marge Simpson
um ... we did n't mention groundskeeper willie , mom .	Bart Simpson
kids , it 's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest . it 's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave .	Marge Simpson
it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month . we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased .	Marge Simpson
lousy smarch weather .	Homer Simpson
do not touch willie . good advice .	Homer Simpson
bart , do n't you realize what this means ? the next time we fall asleep we could die !	Lisa Simpson
it 's no use , bart . we ca n't stay up forever .	Lisa Simpson
you 're right . the only thing left to do is to go into my dream and force willie into a final showdown . you stay awake , and if it looks like i 'm in trouble , wake me up .	Bart Simpson
okay , but promise you wo n't be grouchy .	Lisa Simpson
come on , willie . i know you 're out there .	Bart Simpson
the sandbox !	Bart Simpson

yuh-huh , that 's the deal . no more exercise program ! no more traffic ! no more blood drives or charity walks !	Homer Simpson
dad , i know we do n't do a lot together , but helping you gain 61 pounds is something i want to be a part of .	Bart Simpson
dad --	Lisa Simpson
i must protest . you 're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not saying it is n't sleazy , honey . but try to see it my way . all my life i 've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man 's body .	Homer Simpson
have you told mom about this ?	Lisa Simpson
no . it would only worry her . if you want to add to her worries , go ahead . i guess i 'm just a little more grateful for all she 's done for us .	Homer Simpson
da-ad !	Lisa Simpson

i 'm looking for something loose and billowy . something comfortable for my first day of work .	Homer Simpson
well , i use a computer !	Homer Simpson
i do n't want to look like a weirdo . i 'll just go with a muu-muu .	Homer Simpson

i 'd like to , honey , but i 'm not sure how . your father can be surprisingly sensitive . remember when i giggled at his sherlock holmes hat ? he sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency .	Marge Simpson
well , maybe you 'll have to hurt his feelings . the longer he lives like this , the harder it 'll be to go back .	Lisa Simpson
you 're right . maybe if i use my least nagging tone of voice . homer ? homer ! homer ! that 's it . that 's the one . all right , send him on in .	Marge Simpson
dad ?	Lisa Simpson

yeah , i do n't trust her either . when i was going through her purse , look what i found .	Bart Simpson
mona simpson , mona stevens , martha stewart , penelope olsen , muddy mae suggins ...	Lisa Simpson

first , it was n't 25 years . it was 27 years . and second , she had a very good reason .	Homer Simpson
which was ?	Marge Simpson
i 'unno . i guess i was just a horrible son and no mother would want me .	Homer Simpson
oh , homie . c'mon , you 're a sweet , kind , loving man . i 'm sure you were a wonderful son .	Marge Simpson
then why did she leave me ?	Homer Simpson
let 's find out .	Marge Simpson

spill it , muddy mae , or we 're calling the cops !	Bart Simpson

wow , a former president , living right across the street !	Bart Simpson
why did he have to move in on my territory ? look at him . thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot .	Homer Simpson
stupid president . why could n't he just stay in his own state ?	Homer Simpson
actually this is one of the nine states where mr. bush claims residency , dad . i would n't have voted for him , but it 's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood .	Lisa Simpson
wait a minute . if lisa did n't vote for him , and i did n't vote for him --	Homer Simpson
you did n't vote for anybody .	Marge Simpson
i voted for prell to go back to the old glass bottle . after that , i became deeply cynical .	Homer Simpson

i begged him to stop , but he said it was for the good of the nation .	Bart Simpson
grampa , i know in your day spanking was common , but homer and i just do n't believe in that kind of punishment .	Marge Simpson
first bush invades my home turf , then he takes my pals , then he makes fun of the way i talk ... probably ... , now he steals my right to raise a disobedient , smart-alecky son ! well , that 's it !	Homer Simpson
hey , bush ! get out here !	Homer Simpson

it 's time to hit him where he lives .	Homer Simpson
his house ?	Bart Simpson
bingo .	Homer Simpson
so i thought to myself , what would god do in this situation ?	Homer Simpson
locusts . they 'll drive him nuts .	Bart Simpson

we ca n't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy . we just need a tv . we 're going to go to the outlet mall in ogdenville .	Marge Simpson
look at these low , low prices on famous brand name electronics !	Homer Simpson

90 dollars ? !	Marge Simpson
but it 's marked down from $ 2,800 !	Lisa Simpson
oh , you look so sophisticated -- just like mary hart !	Lisa Simpson
it fits like a dream , too . but we ca n't afford $ 90 even if it is a bargain . it would n't be right to buy something just for me . if it were a suit we could all wear , maybe , then ...	Marge Simpson
c'mon , mom , you never treat yourself to anything .	Lisa Simpson
oh , sure i do . i treated myself to a sanka not three days ago . but this is a real find .	Marge Simpson

yeah . hi , evelyn .	Marge Simpson
i did marry homer .	Marge Simpson
ninety percent of the time , if the gas is n't pumping , this is your problem .	Marge Simpson
we ran with different crowds . you had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping , and i had my home shoe repair course .	Marge Simpson
bart , comb your hair . homer , i do n't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie .	Marge Simpson
but sipowicz does it .	Homer Simpson
if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff , would you do that , too ?	Marge Simpson
i wish i was sipowicz .	Homer Simpson
do i have to go ? that country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers .	Lisa Simpson
i 've told you , i do n't like you using the word hotbed . please , lisa , we so rarely get to do things like this . and everybody -- everybody , please -- be on your best behavior . bart , no grifting .	Marge Simpson

oh , that reminds me of a funny apron i saw ...	Marge Simpson
uh , c'mon , kids , let 's go sit in the car 'til your mom 's done fitting in .	Homer Simpson
i get food through the mail , but in a different way . every month good housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes . sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself .	Marge Simpson
did n't everybody have a wonderful time ? i thought it was so opulent -- like the playboy mansion , but non-sexual .	Marge Simpson
that place is weird . a man in the bathroom kept handing me towels , 'til i paid him to stop .	Bart Simpson
you should 've held out longer , boy .	Homer Simpson
the rich are different from you and me .	Lisa Simpson
yes . they 're better . socially better . and if we fit in , we can be better too . so today , while the rest of you were out being different , i did a very good job of fitting in . so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass . they might even ask us to join !	Marge Simpson
boy , marge , you must 've really done a number on those rich suckers .	Homer Simpson
oh , do n't thank me . thank my beautiful new suit .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know what mom 's thinking . this whole country club scene is so decadent ...	Lisa Simpson
all these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug , complacent parents . it just reinforces ... the unspoken - class - system - of ... horses - sitting - on - their - high ... horses i 'm sorry . i got ta go !	Lisa Simpson
queen of hearts . i believe all the rest are ours .	Marge Simpson
that 's one way .	Homer Simpson
not an issue .	Homer Simpson

marge , did you know that kennedy and lincoln had the same handicap ?	Homer Simpson
homer , please . i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow .	Marge Simpson

seat down .	Homer Simpson
oh , this game could mean big things for me , marge . if i beat mr. burns , i mean really wallop him bad ... i 'm sure to get that big raise i 've been gunning for .	Homer Simpson
all right , all right , but if you win , do n't make a scene and dance around with your `` woo-hoos , '' please . we ca n't afford a single slip-up . they 're judging us .	Marge Simpson
mom , did you like horses when you were my age ? 'cause i heard --	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know . lisa , tonight is very important . mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one .	Marge Simpson
mom , do you want to know the fifteen reasons i like horses better than cars ? one : a horse never --	Lisa Simpson
i really need to concentrate on this , lisa , would you mind --	Marge Simpson
you know how a horse goes like this ? mom ? like this ? mom ?	Lisa Simpson

mom ! mom ! mom ! mom ! mom !	Lisa Simpson

at times like this , i guess all you can do is laugh .	Marge Simpson

bart , you 're seeing krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you 're sorry for causing his death . would it help if i told you you 're not responsible for krusty 's death ?	Lisa Simpson
yes . yes it would .	Bart Simpson
do n't let krusty 's death get you down , boy . people die all the time . just like that . why , you could wake up dead tomorrow . well , good night .	Homer Simpson
krusty !	Bart Simpson
mom ! i just saw krusty !	Bart Simpson

no , on the street .	Bart Simpson
on the street in your mind .	Marge Simpson
why wo n't you believe me ? !	Bart Simpson
sweetheart , maybe you just want krusty to be alive so badly , you think you see him everywhere . i went through the same thing when lyndon johnson died .	Marge Simpson
krusty ? ! doctor hibbert , who was that man ?	Bart Simpson
am i going crazy ? i 'm seeing krusty everywhere .	Bart Simpson
ye olde toast .	Marge Simpson
well i ca n't . you 'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem .	Lisa Simpson
wait a minute ! all those things i saw -- there 's a connection ! the truck full of nets and buckets , the queasy guy , the lobsters ... they all point to one thing . follow me .	Bart Simpson
ahoy ! have you seen this man ?	Bart Simpson
no . we 're looking for this man , krusty the clown .	Lisa Simpson
it 's hopeless , bart . we 've searched up and down these docks , from pier one to that pier 1 by pier seventeen .	Lisa Simpson
lisa ! look ! a signature with stars around it , just like krusty 's !	Bart Simpson
`` rory b. bellows , slip eight ! '' let 's go !	Lisa Simpson
are you rory b. bellows ?	Bart Simpson
how about krusty the clown ?	Bart Simpson
well , if you 're not krusty , how come you have the exact same signature as him ?	Bart Simpson
hey ! you 've got a pacemaker scar just like krusty !	Lisa Simpson
and krusty 's superfluous third nipple !	Bart Simpson
but we saw your plane crash ...	Lisa Simpson
so now that we 've blown your cover , i guess you 've got ta come back and do your show again !	Bart Simpson
or kill us .	Lisa Simpson
but krusty , what about all the kids who depend on you to brighten up their afternoons ? are you going to turn your back on them ?	Bart Simpson
c'mon , lis , krusty does n't want our attention anymore . let 's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity .	Bart Simpson
yeah , krusty does n't want to be a clown . he 's happy just being another blue-collar bozo .	Lisa Simpson
krusty 's tired of having phonies around , pretending to be his friends . i 'm sure he 'll find plenty of people who 'll like him for who he is .	Bart Simpson
what about that great feeling you get from knowing you 're better than regular people ?	Lisa Simpson
what about : being an illiterate tv clown who 's still more respected than all the scientists , doctors and educators in the country put together ?	Bart Simpson
yay !	Lisa Simpson
so krusty , what are you gon na do about your tax problem ?	Bart Simpson
i hope they show the time where they traded guns to the indians for corn , and then the indians shot them and took the corn .	Bart Simpson
hey , they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade . look , i can be a butter churner , a typhoid carrier ... an apprentice ! i think i 'll be an apprentice , marge .	Homer Simpson
what kind of apprentice ?	Marge Simpson
that 's for my master to decide .	Homer Simpson
how about town crier ? you 'd be great at that .	Lisa Simpson
you think so ?	Homer Simpson
yeah , dad ! you 're a big fat loudmouth . and you can walk when you have to .	Bart Simpson
ah ! well , if you kids believe in me that much , i 'll give it my best shot .	Homer Simpson
hi , i 'm lisa simpson . i 'm here to research a report on jebediah .	Lisa Simpson
you su-diddily-uck , flanders ! gim me that !	Homer Simpson
hear ye ! hear ye ! ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all ! chooseth homer simpson and he shalt rock thy world !	Homer Simpson
i was right about jebediah , and now i can prove it .	Lisa Simpson
less chat , more hat .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! hear ye ! hear ye ! the homer broadcasting system is on the air ! all hollering , all the time ! i 'm gon na make the ...	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
wow !	Lisa Simpson
the secret confessions of jebediah springfield ? `` know ye who read this : there is more to my life than history records . ''	Lisa Simpson
-- ha ha ha ha ha . oh my god ! our town hero is a fraud ! `` i write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria . ''	Lisa Simpson
oh , it 's just the excitement of studying jebediah .	Lisa Simpson
just when i was getting over my chester a. arthritis .	Lisa Simpson
uh , no .	Lisa Simpson
hear ye , hear ye ! what 's for breakfast ?	Homer Simpson
toast .	Marge Simpson
i do n't understand thee , marge .	Homer Simpson
what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield was n't as great as he 's cracked up to be ? look .	Lisa Simpson
jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprã¼ngfeld . his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight !	Lisa Simpson
no tongue , eh ? how did he talk and eat and laugh and love ?	Homer Simpson
he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver .	Lisa Simpson
yes , that 'd do .	Homer Simpson
he was one of the evillest men of the 1780 's . he even tried to kill george washington !	Lisa Simpson
the dastard !	Homer Simpson
the next time hans sprã¼ngfeld was seen , he had changed his name to jebediah springfield .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , honey , when my family first came to this state , they had a choice of living in springfield or stenchburg . you know why they chose springfield ? because everyone knows jebediah springfield was a true american hero . end of story .	Marge Simpson
i believe you , honey .	Homer Simpson
you do ?	Lisa Simpson
of course i do . you 're always right about this type of thing , and for once , i want in on the ground floor .	Homer Simpson
aw , thanks , dad .	Lisa Simpson
but it 's all true !	Lisa Simpson
well , nice talking to you .	Homer Simpson
lisa ?	Homer Simpson
miss hoover thought i made the whole thing up . she called me a p.c . thug .	Lisa Simpson
i 've been called a greasy thug too , and it never stops hurting . so here 's what we 're gon na do : grease ourselves up real good , and trash that place with a baseball bat .	Homer Simpson
that wo n't help , dad . no one 's ever going to believe me .	Lisa Simpson
but you have proof ! we could go get that confession out of jebediah 's fife .	Homer Simpson
we could ?	Lisa Simpson
come on , we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case .	Homer Simpson
no baseball bat .	Lisa Simpson
hi , mr. hurlbut .	Lisa Simpson
town crier . i 'd like to ask you a few questions . one : where 's the fife , and two : give me the fife .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah ? well , put this in your fife and smoke it !	Homer Simpson
that 's jebediah 's secret confession . it proves he was a fraud .	Lisa Simpson
but it explains why there 's no record of jebediah before 1795 ! he was hans sprã¼ngfeld until then !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not going to give up . i refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth .	Lisa Simpson
i 'd like 25 copies on goldenrod , 25 on canary , 25 on saffron , and 25 on paella .	Lisa Simpson
you do n't have to help me with this , dad .	Lisa Simpson
oh , sure i do . i always believe in helping the little guy , and you 're the littlest guy i know .	Homer Simpson
no , it 's homer .	Homer Simpson
i 'm just waitin ' for my kid .	Homer Simpson
hi , apu . can i put this poster in your window ?	Lisa Simpson
he would n't let me put it up .	Lisa Simpson
okay , well , that 's not gon na stop us . i know a much better way to get attention ...	Homer Simpson
hear ye , hear ye , my daughter has something to tell you about jebediah springfield .	Homer Simpson
jebediah springfield was nothing more than an evil , blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town !	Lisa Simpson
that 's a myth that got mixed up with the truth .	Lisa Simpson
yes .	Bart Simpson
i hope you know you 're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate !	Lisa Simpson
there is one way : get the silver tongue . if jebediah 's who i say he is , then it should still be in his grave .	Lisa Simpson
dig him up ! dig up that corpse ! ! if you really love jebediah springfield , you 'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong !	Homer Simpson
dig up his grave ! pull out his tongue !	Homer Simpson
yes .	Lisa Simpson
what do we win if the tongue is there ?	Homer Simpson
what a jip .	Homer Simpson
do n't forget to look in his shoes . when i lose something , sometimes it turns up in my shoes .	Lisa Simpson
i was so sure ...	Lisa Simpson
hear ye , hear ye , everybody makes mistakes . let 's go home .	Homer Simpson
no ! nooooooo ! !	Homer Simpson
oh , dad , i 'm really sorry . i know how much you wanted to be in the parade .	Lisa Simpson
oh , it 's not your fault , honey . i 'm supposed to be the responsible one . i should n't have let you let me get carried away .	Homer Simpson
i-i-i ...	Lisa Simpson
general washington ? !	Lisa Simpson
but i 've caused so much trouble already , general washington . i ca n't go on .	Lisa Simpson
no ! not janey ! she 'll pack the supreme court with boys !	Lisa Simpson
oh , let me help you , george washington , i still want to help you .	Lisa Simpson
`` i want to help you , george washington ? '' even your dreams are square .	Bart Simpson
the missing piece of the puzzle ... i 've got it !	Lisa Simpson
that 's because you stole it !	Lisa Simpson
but when you found the truth , you could n't take it ! you could n't stand that you 'd devoted your life to a fraud ! so you covered it up ! did n't you ? did n't you ? !	Lisa Simpson
stop it ! where 's the silver tongue ? !	Lisa Simpson
you did . until i realized that jebediah 's confession was saying more than he meant it to .	Lisa Simpson
how else could he have gotten this ?	Lisa Simpson
exactly .	Lisa Simpson
people of springfield , i , uh , i do n't know quite how to say this ...	Lisa Simpson
i did a lot of research on jebediah springfield and ...	Lisa Simpson
jebediah springfield was ... jebediah was ... great . i , um , just wanted to say that i 've done some research and , uh , he was great .	Lisa Simpson
because the myth of jebediah has value , too . it 's brought out the best in everyone in this town . regardless of who said it , `` a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man . ''	Lisa Simpson
get lost !	Homer Simpson
hear ye , hear ye , hear ye ! !	Homer Simpson
all right ! liver !	Homer Simpson
boy , it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those , huh , kids ? i 'd be a real hot-rod mama , would n't i ? huh ? huh ?	Marge Simpson

mr. smithers , wait !	Homer Simpson
you ca n't let yourself end up in a place like this . you 've got two choices : you can give up on yourself and take the barney-guarding job , like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments . or you can admit to yourself there 's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back .

careful ... careful ...	Bart Simpson
it 's there !	Bart Simpson
umm ... how about ... ghostmutt ?	Marge Simpson
we killed itchy and scratchy ?	Bart Simpson
what are you going to do with all your money , mr. lampwick ?	Marge Simpson
woo hoo ! look , marge ! a couple of bucks !	Homer Simpson
what the hell is this ?	Bart Simpson
it 's one of those campy 70 's throwbacks that appeals to generation x'ers .	Lisa Simpson

so it 's true . some cartoons do encourage violence .	Lisa Simpson
ow ! we got ta get itchy and scratchy back .	Bart Simpson

okay .	Lisa Simpson
yes , well , technically everything worked out all right . but ...	Lisa Simpson
but ?	Marge Simpson
well ... i was n't the one who solved the problem and neither was lisa . there 's something unsettling about that .	Bart Simpson
wait , kids . you ca n't give up on itchy and scratchy . you 're always so good at these things . why , together you 've reunited krusty with his father , gotten principal skinner his job back , and helped dr. riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father . you 've even foiled sideshow bob on five separate occasions , and he 's an evil genius .	Marge Simpson
you 're right , mom . i 'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too .	Lisa Simpson
bart ! look at this !	Lisa Simpson
what a perfect plan . now roger myers ' hotel is just around the --	Bart Simpson
what the hell is going on ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't know . but it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden .	Lisa Simpson
i never even heard about that .	Bart Simpson
i do n't understand it . we 're always the ones who solve these problems .	Lisa Simpson
i guess you do n't need it now , but we had a plan too .	Bart Simpson
you kids must be so happy . your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air .	Marge Simpson
dad , what 's a `` muppet ? ''	Lisa Simpson
well , it 's not quite a mop , and it 's not quite a puppet , but , man ... so to answer your question , i do n't know .	Homer Simpson
why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?	Bart Simpson
that 's not a leather muppet , that 's troy mcclure . oh , back in the '70s , he was quite the teen heartthrob !	Marge Simpson
yeah , who'd 've thought he 'd turn out to be such a weirdo ?	Homer Simpson
what are you talking about ?	Marge Simpson
you know , his bizarre `` personal '' life ? those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium ? why i heard ...	Homer Simpson
homer ! that 's just an urban legend . people do n't do that type of thing with fish . troy mcclure is a perfect gentlemen , like bing crosby or jfk . i wonder where troy is now ?	Marge Simpson
troy mcclure ? he 's a washed-up movie star . he could be dating washed-up supermodels .	Homer Simpson
sounds like you 're really falling for him .	Marge Simpson
patty ! go on , selma , tell me more .	Marge Simpson
this play has everything !	Bart Simpson
oh , i love legitimate theater .	Homer Simpson
down in front !	Homer Simpson
hi . i remember you from such film strips as `` locker room towel fight : the blinding of larry driscoll . ''	Lisa Simpson
ah-huh .	Lisa Simpson
i know ! i know ! it 's selma , right ?	Homer Simpson
aw , hell . well ... what about dracula ?	Homer Simpson
troy , buddy , i got ta know . what 's a great guy like you wan na marry a guy like selma ?	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
hey , look what i snagged , marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake .	Homer Simpson
mmmm ... pointy .	Homer Simpson
it was a beautiful wedding . i 've never seen selma happier .	Marge Simpson
that reminds me -- troy said something interesting last night at the bar . apparently he does n't really love selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career . well , enough talk . let 's snuggle .	Homer Simpson
what ? ! ! oh , my god !	Marge Simpson
marge , could you close your eyes ? i 'm trying to sleep .	Homer Simpson
selma ... about you and troy . we 're not sure he 's ... all he seems .	Marge Simpson
selma ! troy does n't love you at all ! he 's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career !	Marge Simpson
santa ?	Lisa Simpson
go to work with your parents day ?	Bart Simpson
i still do n't understand why you get to stay home and watch mom work .	Lisa Simpson
because i 've always been an advocate of women in the workplace , lis .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't help it if mom 's workplace contains our tv .	Bart Simpson
'cause they wo n't hire an assistant .	Homer Simpson
i 'm honored , bart . and lisa , you 'll have a fine time at the plant with dad . you 've been interested in nuclear power for years .	Marge Simpson
i 've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant .	Lisa Simpson
well , there you go .	Marge Simpson
mom , you 're blocking the tv . if you need something to do , you can fill out my form . here .	Bart Simpson
`` parent 's occupation ... please note : homemaker is not allowed , as it is not real work . that 's why you do n't get paid for it . ''	Marge Simpson
bart can take my place at the plant !	Lisa Simpson
oh , but he so wanted to see women in the workplace ...	Marge Simpson
well , how about aunt patty and aunt selma at the d.m.v . ?	Lisa Simpson
of course ! of course ! i would never , ever have thought of that !	Marge Simpson
well , at least i 'm not stuck at the cracker factory like milhouse .	Bart Simpson
donut ?	Homer Simpson
no , thanks . do you have any fruit ?	Lisa Simpson
this has purple stuff inside . purple is a fruit .	Homer Simpson
uh ... oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country . as a safety inspector , i am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs .	Homer Simpson
why are there so many burnt-out ones ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry . i guess watching me is n't any more exciting than being me .	Homer Simpson
maybe we can make your job more fun ... what are those ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know .	Homer Simpson
well , what if we used our imaginations ... ?	Lisa Simpson
houston , we have a problem . homer 13 is spinning out of control !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm going after him !	Lisa Simpson
boy , this is a lot more fun with a second person !	Homer Simpson
yes . you are right , milhouse . it is a fake . which makes it a fake i.d .	Bart Simpson
and it 's our ticket to the best spring break of our lives !	Bart Simpson
one adult and two children , please .	Bart Simpson
are you kidding ? i take it as a compliment ! three beers , please !	Bart Simpson
maybe when we find something decent to do with this i.d .	Bart Simpson
well , we 're having the best spring break of our lives , and we do n't need you around nerding it up .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah , right . like there 's any way to get some kicks with a big wad of cash and a license to drive ...	Bart Simpson
gentlemen , for our road trip , i have taken the liberty of preparing an airtight and utterly plausible alibi for use on our parents ...	Bart Simpson
the national grammar rodeo ! i wish i were going . oh , wait , wait -- i mean , i wish i was going . is that right , bart ?	Marge Simpson
it 's not fair ! i 'm the best student in school . how come i never heard about this competition ?	Lisa Simpson
maybe because you are , as we say in latin , a dorkus malorkus .	Bart Simpson
that 's not latin . mom , bart 's faking it .	Lisa Simpson
oh , honey , you 've had your glory . now it 's bart 's turn .	Marge Simpson
he sure did .	Bart Simpson
cruise control , my good man . everybody all set back here ? nelson , good to see you ! martin , always a pleasure ...	Bart Simpson
oh , diablo canyon 2 ... why ca n't you be more like diablo canyon 1 ?	Homer Simpson
hello ? ... oh , homie , hello ! i ca n't remember the last time you called me from -- oh , you want to speak to lisa ?	Marge Simpson
hi , lisa . how 's your spring break going ?	Homer Simpson

zhã¨ shã¬ nide yã¡njing .	Bart Simpson

langdon alger ? oh , i do n't like him anymore ... okay , but you 've got to promise you wo n't get mad or tell anyone , especially bart .	Lisa Simpson
i promise .	Homer Simpson
bart rented a car with a phony driver 's license and drove milhouse , nelson , and martin to a wig outlet in knoxville and the car got crushed and they 're out of money and they ca n't get home and bart 's working as a courier and just came back from hong kong .	Lisa Simpson

all right , i have thought this through . i will send bart the money to fly home , and then i will murder him .	Homer Simpson
no , no ! then he 'll know i told ! dad , you said i could trust you .	Lisa Simpson
okay , we 'll work this out together . first things first : where is knoxville ?	Homer Simpson
it 's in tennessee , right next to the oak ridge nuclear facility , birthplace of the atomic bomb .	Lisa Simpson
well , maybe we could order something from oak ridge ...	Homer Simpson
... and bart could be the courier !	Lisa Simpson
y'ello , oak ridge ? this is springfield nuclear . we need to order a ... uh ... t-437 safety command console .	Homer Simpson
and have it sent to the springfield nuclear power plant , care of homer j. --	Homer Simpson
no ! do n't use your real name , or bart will know !	Lisa Simpson

homer , are you laughing at me ?	Marge Simpson
sometimes i wonder about all the people in this town . do you think anything interesting ever happens to them ? i mean , there must be thousands of great stories out there .	Bart Simpson
what do you think , milhouse ? milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
forget it . c'mon , it 's 11 o'clock . i need some sugar .	Bart Simpson
mom , dad threw his beer can at the miracle gro guy on tv . can i recycle it ?	Lisa Simpson
why not .	Marge Simpson
waaa ! uhh ! there 's gum in my hair !	Lisa Simpson
mo-om ! someone threw gum in my hair !	Lisa Simpson
are you sure ? maybe it 's just shampoo . that washes right out .	Marge Simpson
no , it 's somebody 's gross gum ! get it out ! ow ! ow ! it 's pulling out my hairs !	Lisa Simpson
wait -- if i remember my heloise , the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter .	Marge Simpson
there . now that gum should lift right out .	Marge Simpson
why me ? yuk ! i smell like a sandwich .	Lisa Simpson
gaaah !	Lisa Simpson
helms calls for donut tax ? !	Homer Simpson
there . done and done .	Homer Simpson
oh , why did i have to stop at the railroad tracks ? better get some change .	Homer Simpson
it 's okay . it 's okay . i 'm back . see , daddy 's here .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , maggie , maybe if you just squeeze a little ...	Homer Simpson
that 's it , that 's it , i ...	Homer Simpson
okay . okay . think , homer ...	Homer Simpson
... the dog !	Homer Simpson
okay ! go , boy ! go find help ! go find help , boy !	Homer Simpson
oh , bad dog ! bad dog !	Homer Simpson
oh , do n't worry , maggie ! i 'll think of something !	Homer Simpson
no , i 've got gum in my hair !	Lisa Simpson
oh , we 've tried everything . olive oil , lemon juice , tartar sauce , chocolate syrup , gravy , bacon fat , hummus and baba ghanouj ...	Marge Simpson
my scalp hurts from horsefly bites .	Lisa Simpson
that sounds okay ...	Lisa Simpson
ah ! ah ! ah ! stop ! stop !	Lisa Simpson
does the whole town have to hear about this ?	Lisa Simpson
cut it off , but be careful .	Lisa Simpson
i love it ! i finally look like a real person ! thanks !	Lisa Simpson
he 's down there .	Lisa Simpson
well , milhouse , i guess interesting stuff does happen to people in springfield .	Bart Simpson
there 's just not enough time to hear 'em all ...	Bart Simpson
grampa ! i do n't mind when you spit at home , but i have to work with these people .	Bart Simpson
grampa , hush .	Bart Simpson
here , why do n't you spit some more .	Bart Simpson
oh , please , no .	Bart Simpson
... and then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other . why is he always making up those crazy stories ?	Bart Simpson
maybe it 's time we put grampa in a home .	Homer Simpson
you already put him in a home .	Lisa Simpson
maybe it 's time to put him in one where he ca n't get out .	Bart Simpson
no ! old people deserve our respect ! look at jacques cousteau and goldie hawn . you would n't shut them away like second-class citizens .	Lisa Simpson
second class ? what about social security , bus discounts , medic-alert jewelry , gold bond powder , pants all the way up to your armpits , and all those other senior perks ? oh , if you ask me , old folks have it pretty sweet .	Homer Simpson
who is it ?	Homer Simpson
it 's grampa . and it sounds like he 's gotten into the horseradish again .	Marge Simpson
uh , grampa , maybe i should moisten your washcloth ...	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm sure you 'll make up something . maybe you just need more of my classmates around .	Bart Simpson
wow , he 's even more agitated than usual . maybe we should let him stay .	Lisa Simpson
but where are we going to put him ?	Marge Simpson
bart 's room .	Homer Simpson
bart 's room .	Lisa Simpson
bart 's room .	Marge Simpson
dumpster .	Bart Simpson
look , if you 're going to stay in my room , could you at least stop making up gibberish ?	Bart Simpson
wrinkly gibberish ?	Bart Simpson
mmm-hmm . you bossed around the richest , most powerful guy in town . how come you were a sergeant and he was only a private ?	Bart Simpson
well , if you saved burns ' life , why does he want to kill you ?	Bart Simpson
great story , grampa . coulda used a vampire , though . 'night .	Bart Simpson
oh wow ! there really is a treasure ! whatever you do , do n't give him the key , grampa !	Bart Simpson
figures ... hey , mr. burns !	Bart Simpson
can i go with you to get the treasure ? i wo n't eat much and i do n't know the difference between right and wrong .	Bart Simpson
not without the keys , he is n't .	Bart Simpson
now we can get the treasure !	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe you , grampa . the sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like burns ! you got ta get that treasure ! you got ta do it for ox and asa and griff and burnsie ... well , not so much burnsie .	Bart Simpson
uh , yes . but we got ta act fast !	Bart Simpson
where are you two going at this hour ?	Homer Simpson
on a treasure hunt .	Bart Simpson
oh , can i come ?	Homer Simpson

hey , grampa , do you think your dead buddies get up and walk around at night ?	Bart Simpson
-- sixty-four times . no more , no less . got it .	Bart Simpson
gotcha . hey , grampa , do you think i could 've been a flying hellfish ?	Bart Simpson
wo-o-o-ow !	Bart Simpson
huh . the light must 've burned out .	Bart Simpson
you coward ! you 're an embarrassment to the name `` hellfish ! ''	Bart Simpson
i 'm sorry i cost you your fortune , grampa .	Bart Simpson
consarn it , he 's getting away !	Bart Simpson
you 're rich , grampa ! you did it ! and burns can never take that away from you !	Bart Simpson
you never were , grampa .	Bart Simpson
i wo n't get embarrassed . i do n't care who knows i love my grampa .	Bart Simpson
looks like bad news for the ... ... '' impson '' family .	Homer Simpson
let 's all calm down . everyone 's going to be just fine , as long as i 've got enough beer .	Homer Simpson
all right , that does it . if i 'm gon na be trapped inside the house i got ta go out and buy some beer .	Homer Simpson
now to drop gracefully through the windshield .	Homer Simpson
i 've got ya , dad !	Bart Simpson
well , things were bad everywhere .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sick of these constant bear attacks ! it 's like the freakin ' country bear jamboroo around here .	Homer Simpson
hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon , that 's your business . but i 'm not gon na take it ! who 's with me ?	Homer Simpson
we 're here ! we 're queer ! we do n't want any more bears !	Homer Simpson
oh , i heard it at the mustache parade they have every year .	Homer Simpson
mr. mayor , i hate to break it to you , but your city is infested with bears .	Homer Simpson
ahh , not a bear in sight . the bear patrol must be working like a charm .	Homer Simpson
that 's specious reasoning , dad .	Lisa Simpson
thank you , honey .	Homer Simpson
by your logic , i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away .	Lisa Simpson
oh , how does it work ?	Homer Simpson
it does n't work .	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
it 's just a stupid rock .	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
but i do n't see any tigers around here , do you ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , i want to buy your rock .	Homer Simpson
woo-hoo ! a perfect day -- zero bears , and one big fat hairy paycheck !	Homer Simpson
hey ... how come my pay is so low ?	Homer Simpson
bear patrol tax : $ 5 ? ! what ? ! this is an outrage ! it 's the biggest tax increase in history !	Homer Simpson
actually , dad , it 's the smallest tax increase in history .	Lisa Simpson
let the bears pay the bear tax . i pay the homer tax .	Homer Simpson
that 's the home-owner tax .	Lisa Simpson
well , anyway , i 'm still outraged .	Homer Simpson
i do n't see how you can support proposition 24 , dad .	Lisa Simpson
open your eyes , lisa . our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants , kids like bart have lost the will to learn .	Homer Simpson
there 's no denying it , sis .	Bart Simpson
but immigration is what america 's all about . even the simpson family immigrated to america . right , grampa ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , when those immigrants get deported , there 'll be more elbow room for regular joes like you and me , apu .	Homer Simpson
you ? pfft . i do n't believe it .	Homer Simpson
oh my god . i got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of proposition 24 , i never stopped to think it might affect someone i cared about .	Homer Simpson
you know what , apu ... i am really , really gon na miss you .	Homer Simpson
yeah . those are exactly my sentimonies .	Homer Simpson
it 's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien .	Marge Simpson
hey , what 's this one for ?	Bart Simpson
so apu , why did n't you go back to india when your student visa expired ?	Marge Simpson
uh-huh .	Marge Simpson
what you 're saying is so understandable ... and really , your only crime was violating u.s. law .	Marge Simpson
you know what ? i 'm going to vote `` no '' on 24 .	Marge Simpson
mom , you 're the greatest . can i have this licorice ?	Lisa Simpson
low and lazy , so -- hey ! say something again .	Homer Simpson
hey , you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue .	Homer Simpson
do n't forget ganesha .	Homer Simpson
there was an amnesty declared for people who 've been here as long as you ! that means you can take the citizenship test !	Lisa Simpson
wow . you must love this country more than i love a cold beer on a hot christmas morning . darn it , apu , i 'm not gon na let them kick you out !	Homer Simpson
i never should have bought this button . can i have my three dollars back ?	Homer Simpson
hey marge , look what i brought home .	Homer Simpson
oh , homer . are you rounding up immigrants ?	Marge Simpson
no , marge . apu convinced me that proposition 24 is a big mistake .	Homer Simpson
all right ! now you 've got all the simpsons behind you , apu !	Lisa Simpson
and i 'm not registered !	Homer Simpson
hey , apu , why do n't just marry some american broad , then dump her after you get your citizenship ?	Bart Simpson
hello , selma ? selma my dear ? how are you ? uh-huh ... uh-huh ... uh-huh ... listen , shut up for a second . how would you like to marry apu so he does n't get deported ?	Homer Simpson
that 's it !	Lisa Simpson
didja hear that , mom ? she 's as dumb as me !	Bart Simpson
no , not what he said -- what he is . grandfather . as in `` grandfather clause '' . apu , how long ago did your visa expire ?	Lisa Simpson
but apu , the vote on proposition 24 is tuesday . you 'll have to pass the test before then .	Marge Simpson
oh . it ca n't be that many . c'mon , apu . i 'll be your tutor .	Homer Simpson
please identify this object .	Homer Simpson
correct . now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck . but why does the american flag have precisely 47 stars ?	Homer Simpson
uh ... partial credit .	Homer Simpson
now , they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the u.s , so let 's do that . uh , springfield , springfield ... ah , right here .	Homer Simpson
da-ad ! you 're not pointing anywhere near springfield . it 's over here , apu .	Lisa Simpson
hey , whatcha doin -- studyin ' ?	Bart Simpson
no , no , and no . maybe we should start all over with the electrical college .	Homer Simpson
sleep is for the weak , apu ! now i 'm gon na go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history .	Homer Simpson
perfect . let 's roll .	Lisa Simpson
what ?	Homer Simpson
you know , apu , in a way , all americans are immigrants -- except native americans .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , native americans like us .	Homer Simpson
no , i mean american indians .	Lisa Simpson
no , i mean --	Lisa Simpson
hi , everyone . if i could just say a few words ... i 'd be a better public speaker .	Homer Simpson
now that you 're all relaxed ... most of us here were born in america . we take this country for granted . but not immigrants like apu . while the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid , they 're driving the cabs that get us home safely ...	Homer Simpson
they 're writing the operas that entertain us every day ...	Homer Simpson
they 're training our tigers , and kicking our extra points ... these people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society .	Homer Simpson
if we pass proposition 24 , we 'll be losing some of the truest americans of all .	Homer Simpson
when you go to the polls tomorrow , please -- vote `` no '' on proposition 24 !	Homer Simpson
no on 24 ! no on 24 ! no on 24 ! no - on - twen - ty - four !	Homer Simpson
when are people going to learn -- democracy does n't work !	Homer Simpson
just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about .	Marge Simpson
`` dear parents . due to yesterday 's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard , the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks . by reading this letter out loud , you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity , throughout the universe . ''	Marge Simpson
well we 'll have to organize a carpool . every day will be like a road trip ! ... with your dad ! ... to school !	Homer Simpson
so how 'bout those rainbow suspenders , huh ?	Homer Simpson
dad ?	Bart Simpson
pretty cool way to keep your pants up , eh ?	Homer Simpson
dad ?	Bart Simpson
i see these kids now with `` jive '' printed on their shirts . now , i can teach you how you 're supposed to say `` jive '' ...	Homer Simpson
dad ? please just drive the car , dad .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm watching the road , sweetie . `` you jiiive turkey ! '' see ? you got to `` sass '' it . `` quit jiiiving me , turkey ! '' you got ta `` sass '' it . a turkey is a bad person .	Homer Simpson
but this is grand funk railroad ! you guys back there know grand funk , right ?	Homer Simpson
nobody knows the band , grand funk ? the wild shirtless lyrics of mark farner ? the bong-rattling bass of mel schacher ? the competent drumwork of don brewer ? oh , man .	Homer Simpson
for more information on grand funk , consult your school library !	Homer Simpson
and when i listen to a really good song , i start nodding my head , like i 'm saying `` yes ! '' to every beat . `` yes , yes , yes this rocks ! '' and then sometimes i switch it up like `` no , no , no , do n't stop a-rockin ' ... ''	Homer Simpson
dad , please . you 're embarrassing us .	Bart Simpson
no , i 'm not . i 'm teaching you about rock music .	Homer Simpson
now -- grand funk railroad paved the way for jefferson airplane , which cleared the way for jefferson starship . the stage was now set for the alan parsons project , which i believe was some sort of hovercraft ...	Homer Simpson
dad ! no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands ! you have the worst , lamest taste in music ever !	Bart Simpson
i 'm just trying to party with you guys .	Homer Simpson
homer , first of all it 's `` par-tay . '' and second , we would n't par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth .	Bart Simpson
hi there ! been a while since i set foot in good vibrations music . where can i find the latest releases by `` bread ? ''	Homer Simpson
oldies ?	Homer Simpson
but you 've got all the top bands in here . styx ? i just heard them on `` the king biscuit flour hour . '' now here are some of your no-name bands : sonic youth , nine inch nails , hullabalooza ...	Homer Simpson
there can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime , and it 's the us festival .	Homer Simpson
the us festival ! geez ! it was sponsored by that guy from apple computers .	Homer Simpson
why do you need new bands ? everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. it 's a scientific fact .	Homer Simpson
back then , we did n't care what anyone thought , and the chicks found that irresistible .	Homer Simpson
but most of all , i remember the music .	Homer Simpson
you make me feel like dancing ...	Homer Simpson
you would n't understand , dad . you 're not with it .	Homer Simpson
no way , man . we 're gon na keep on rocking forever ... forever ... forever ...	Homer Simpson
forever ... forever ... forever ...	Homer Simpson
what 's wrong , homie ?	Marge Simpson
i went to the record store today , and they were playing all this music i 'd never heard of . it was like the store had gone crazy .	Homer Simpson
record stores have always seemed crazy to me , but it does n't upset me . music is none of my business .	Marge Simpson
that 's fine for you , marge . but i used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day . then it was every other day . now i 'm lucky if i can find half an hour a week in which to get funky . i 've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove !	Homer Simpson
well , good . try to include bart and lisa .	Marge Simpson
dear lord , if you keep homer from embarrassing us today , we promise to build several churches in your honor .	Bart Simpson
bart , no !	Lisa Simpson
dad , you forgot to pick up milhouse !	Lisa Simpson
i did ? i must be getting forgetful in my old age . open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine .	Homer Simpson
what are you talking about ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... what have we here ? looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to hullabalooza .	Homer Simpson
bart , these look real .	Lisa Simpson
check the authenticator spot .	Bart Simpson
you 're not going to school today . today , your classroom will be the capitol city amphitheater . your teacher ? four dozen rock bands . so get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father . woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
wow , it 's like woodstock . only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards .	Lisa Simpson
oh , my homemade kahlua .	Homer Simpson
generation x may be shallow , but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people .	Lisa Simpson
hey , a freak show !	Homer Simpson
what is that smell ?	Bart Simpson
it smells like otto 's jacket .	Lisa Simpson
oh , i get it .	Homer Simpson
dad , you can not wear that ! that 's a rastafarian hat !	Bart Simpson
hey , i 've been safari-in ' since before you were born .	Homer Simpson
wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music .	Lisa Simpson
well , excuuuuuuse me !	Homer Simpson
you know what , dad ? maybe we 'll go exploring on our own for a while .	Bart Simpson
well , homer , this is it . time to get back with the people . the young people .	Homer Simpson
alright . yeah .	Homer Simpson
cool concert , am i right ?	Homer Simpson
what did i say ? what 's going on ?	Homer Simpson
okay , i 'm heading out now ! more butt support ! more butt support !	Homer Simpson
it may be bleak , but this music is really getting to the crowd .	Lisa Simpson
aw , making teenagers depressed is like shootin ' fish in a barrel .	Bart Simpson
oh , it makes no sense . i have n't changed since high school and suddenly i 'm uncool . i 've been kicked out of paradise .	Homer Simpson
i 'll never be part of the scene again !	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
dad , are you okay ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm fine .	Homer Simpson
so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show .	Marge Simpson
i do n't think i have a choice , marge .	Homer Simpson
of course you have a choice .	Marge Simpson
how do you figure ?	Homer Simpson
you do n't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along .	Marge Simpson
you know , marge , in some ways you and i are very different people ...	Homer Simpson
hi , everybody . is everybody ... good ?	Homer Simpson
thank you . thank you very much .	Homer Simpson
`` stay in school . your hero , homer . ''	Homer Simpson
homer simpson , smiling politely . you know , my kids think you 're the greatest . and thanks to your gloomy music they 've finally stopped dreaming of a future i ca n't possibly provide .	Homer Simpson
dear bart and lisa ...	Bart Simpson
all is well on tour with america 's most popular alternative music festival ...	Homer Simpson
our first job is to entertain ...	Homer Simpson
... and i like to think sometimes we get a message across as well .	Homer Simpson
but the main thing is , i 've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock ' n ' roll the king of musics .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
hello , ticket-holders !	Homer Simpson
thank you ! and remember : do n't trust anyone over thirty . and now , peter frampton !	Homer Simpson
really ? me , too . but i got kicked out 'cause of my views on vietnam . also , i was stealing projectors .	Homer Simpson

that was odd .	Homer Simpson
no biggie . i 'm cool .	Homer Simpson
rules . i 'm a rocker . i do n't care for rules .	Homer Simpson
die ? well , you do n't scare me , doc . 'cause dying would be a stone groove . got any messages for jimi hendrix ?	Homer Simpson
so what 's it like being famous , dad ?	Bart Simpson
people know your name , but you do n't know theirs . it 's great .	Homer Simpson
dad , do you wear boxers or briefs ?	Bart Simpson
nope .	Homer Simpson
what religion are you ?	Bart Simpson
you know , the one with all the well-meaning rules that do n't work out in real life -- christianity .	Homer Simpson
what 's with all the questions ?	Homer Simpson
just some report i got ta do for school . hey , you want some pie ?	Bart Simpson
sure , we 've got a lotta catchin ' up to do .	Homer Simpson
this is so exciting . last time i got to go backstage was when bart ripped his pants at the christmas play .	Marge Simpson
mo-om !	Bart Simpson
now this i like .	Marge Simpson
... so i realized that being with my family is more important than being cool .	Homer Simpson
oh , this is heavy . okay , homer , do n't fear the reaper .	Homer Simpson
oh , i 'm gon na die .	Homer Simpson
cannons are designed to hurt . they 're designed to hurt .	Marge Simpson
shh , mom . dad needs our support .	Lisa Simpson
you 're the coolest dad alive !	Bart Simpson
oh , marge . i thought i had an appetite for destruction , but all i wanted was a club sandwich .	Homer Simpson
there might be one in this cooler .	Marge Simpson
oh . here we go .	Marge Simpson
you have a desk ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll miss you pumpkins , but i just ca n't share your bleak world view . i 've got too much to live for .	Homer Simpson
dad , what you just said was powerfully un-cool .	Bart Simpson
you know what the song says , `` it 's hip to be square . ''	Homer Simpson
that song is so lame .	Lisa Simpson
so lame that it 's cool ?	Homer Simpson
no .	Lisa Simpson

yeah , they wo n't learn anything about apples today .	Homer Simpson
twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life .	Homer Simpson
next to spring and winter , fall is my absolute favorite season . just look at all this beautiful foilage .	Marge Simpson
it 's not foilage , mom . it 's foliage . fo-li-age .	Lisa Simpson
that 's what i said , foilage . it does n't take a nucular scientist to pronounce foilage .	Marge Simpson
i can honestly say that was the most fun i 've ever had . the mill , the history , all that gorgeous foliage .	Marge Simpson
i ca n't excape lisa , our little walking libary !	Marge Simpson
ca n't they get a pole for that sign ?	Homer Simpson
that 's a hitchhiker , homer .	Bart Simpson

we 're not picking him up !	Marge Simpson
oh , yes we are !	Homer Simpson
there 's not enough room !	Marge Simpson
oh , yes , there is !	Homer Simpson
i just do n't think it 's a good idea .	Marge Simpson
and i think it 's the best idea i 've ever had ! we 're picking up the weirdo , and that 's final .	Homer Simpson
careful of the apple pie on the seat .	Marge Simpson
grampa , are you sitting on the pie ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , sure , we know him . that 's mr. burns .	Bart Simpson
he tried to kill our puppies .	Lisa Simpson
he sexually harassed me .	Marge Simpson
he made fun of my weight .	Homer Simpson
yay , mom ! all right , mom !	Marge Simpson
hey , you 're that hitchhiker ! what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
wow , that 's really lazy .	Homer Simpson
so lazy .	Homer Simpson
... and larry and i have so much in common , marge , way more than you and me . if i could be stranded on an island with anyone , it would definitely be larry !	Homer Simpson
i think we heard enough about larry burns for one evening .	Marge Simpson
why ? it 's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today .	Homer Simpson
yes , sir . i do .	Homer Simpson
oh , all the time ! have you ever heard of this kid milhouse ? he 's a little wiener who ...	Homer Simpson
eh , i should go .	Homer Simpson
it 's so unfair . you 're everything a dad could hope for .	Homer Simpson
larry , there 's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you . and that ... is a phony kidnapping .	Homer Simpson
pho-ny kid-napping ...	Homer Simpson
what are you doing in the basement ? it 's like you 're hiding out down here .	Marge Simpson
hiding out ? marge , you 've been reading too many hideout books .	Homer Simpson
and what 's that hitchhiker doing here ? is every drifter we meet going to move in with us ?	Marge Simpson
of course not . we 'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis .	Homer Simpson
he 's not a drifter , mom . that 's mr. burns 's son , larry .	Lisa Simpson
he 's great at pointing out everyone 's foibles !	Bart Simpson
he 's kidding , mom . but seriously , i 'd love to have hair like yours -- i just ca n't get the zoning permits .	Bart Simpson
hey , that reminds me , mom -- buckingham palace called . they want their hat back .	Lisa Simpson
more food .	Bart Simpson
oh . yeah . thank you .	Marge Simpson
hello , mr. burns , this is the kidnapper . do you miss your son ?	Homer Simpson

i hate pai gow . ca n't we just play quang jong ?	Bart Simpson
ca n't we just go upstairs ?	Marge Simpson

marge , it 's not a real kidnapping . it 's a simple hoax to win a father 's love .	Homer Simpson
you know how i feel about hoaxes !	Marge Simpson
still ?	Homer Simpson
i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now , before you get in a lot of trouble .	Marge Simpson

we 've got to go down there and help dad !	Lisa Simpson
it 'll be okay , honey . there 's lots more oil where that came from .	Homer Simpson
hold on , mr. burns . maybe we did fake a kidnapping , but is that really such a crime ? all your son wanted was a little attention , a little love .	Homer Simpson
i 'm a father myself , sir . and sure , sometimes my kids can be obnoxious ... or boring ... or stinky --	Homer Simpson
-- but they can always count on one thing : their father 's unconditional love .	Homer Simpson
who 's playing that music ?	Lisa Simpson
and where is all that liquor coming from ?	Marge Simpson
it 's a party , marge . it does n't have to make sense .	Homer Simpson
da-ad ! v-chip , v-chip !	Lisa Simpson
sorry , sorry . my fault .	Homer Simpson
someone found my keys !	Homer Simpson
oh , no !	Lisa Simpson
... and we 'd be doing our part for the environment ! plus , we 'd get to clean up all those cute animals .	Lisa Simpson
honey , we do n't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals . you can stay right here and give the dog a bath . or trim the cat 's nails .	Marge Simpson
oh , mom , please ! you can make this my birthday and christmas presents !	Lisa Simpson
you 've already used up your birthday and christmas presents on that peach tree we got you . and you hardly ever play with that anymore .	Marge Simpson

helen , as a responsible parent , i was already well aware of that .	Homer Simpson
oh , no ? ! well , if homer simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house , then homer simpson 's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house ! that 's ...	Homer Simpson
`` maison derriere '' ? ! i ca n't believe there 's a place like that in our wholesome little town . homer , did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent bart to work there ?	Marge Simpson
no ! i only learned that four days ago .	Homer Simpson
what were you thinking , sending bart to such an awful place ?	Marge Simpson
i was trying to punish him exactly like you would . so , in a way , you really dropped the ball on this one . this is your mess and i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na clean it up !	Homer Simpson
i have a favor to ask : please shut this place down and move away from springfield .	Marge Simpson
springfield does n't want places like this !	Marge Simpson
oh ? i 've lived in this town for 37 years .	Marge Simpson
i 'm third generation .	Marge Simpson
get out of my town !	Marge Simpson
is that so ? well , sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial !	Marge Simpson
you 're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the english language are marge simpson !	Marge Simpson
it 's the light pink '87 wagon .	Marge Simpson
i 'm here to share my moral outrage , but this time it 's not about that giant , inflatable dos equis bottle . it 's about a certain house in our town ...	Marge Simpson
no . it 's a house of ill fame ... a house of loose ethics ...	Marge Simpson
the house is perfectly fine !	Marge Simpson
oh , geez -- it 's what 's inside the house that 's disgraceful -- drinking , gambling , and debauchery ! it 's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque !	Marge Simpson

do n't you worry , son .	Homer Simpson
my friends ! stop !	Homer Simpson
sure , we could tear this house down ...	Homer Simpson
no ! my friends ! stop !	Homer Simpson
let me finish . we could tear it down , but we 'd be tearing down a part of ourselves ...	Homer Simpson
you could close down moe 's or the kwik-e-mart , and nobody would care / but the heart and soul of springfield 's in our maison derriere ...	Homer Simpson
to shut them down now would be twisted ,	Bart Simpson
here i come , everybody !	Marge Simpson

oh , i hate having parties . the toilet always gets backed up .	Homer Simpson
i do n't care if the sink shoots sludge , we 're having a party .	Marge Simpson

marge , please , that was twenty minutes ago .	Homer Simpson
i should n't have served those north korean fortune cookies . they were so insulting : `` you are a coward . '' no one likes to hear that after a nice meal .	Marge Simpson
you ca n't keep blaming yourself . just blame yourself once and move on .	Homer Simpson

you 've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she 's stood by you . why would she leave you now ?	Lisa Simpson
'cause there 's lots of stuff she does n't know about .	Homer Simpson
you mean like your poker shack out in the swamp ?	Lisa Simpson
mm-hm .	Homer Simpson

you 're very lucky to have mom .	Lisa Simpson

i did n't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on tv . this one is for real . i want our marriage to be perfect , right from the start , so we do n't end up like kirk and luann .	Homer Simpson
we never will .	Marge Simpson
wait ! i want one last chance to enjoy single life .	Homer Simpson

what a wonderful evening ! a magical way for two people to renew their love .	Marge Simpson
whaddya mean ?	Homer Simpson
well , it was like that when i got here . it really was .	Homer Simpson
hey , what 's this thing ?	Homer Simpson
telemarketing , eh ?	Homer Simpson
um , i do n't think you want to look in there , sir .	Bart Simpson
who does nelson think he 's impressing , anyway , acting so cool all the time ?	Lisa Simpson
why do you have to be such a pain all the time ? do n't you realize you 're getting a bad reputation ?	Lisa Simpson
it does not !	Lisa Simpson
hey !	Lisa Simpson
an automatic dialer ? is that legal ? i do n't want you getting arrested , homer ...	Marge Simpson
i wo n't .	Homer Simpson

let me show you how it works . this baby has every phone number in town programmed into it . it automatically calls them one by one and plays my message . listen .	Homer Simpson
now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in !	Homer Simpson
but you 're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars . it 's nothing but panhandling !	Marge Simpson
tele-panhandling .	Homer Simpson
no , sir . i was laughing at something outside .	Lisa Simpson
oh , how does bart do this every week ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's your fault ! i accidentally laughed at your immature prank .	Lisa Simpson
thanks , but i prefer the honest way .	Lisa Simpson
wow , that was a good idea . and i ca n't believe it came from nelson .	Lisa Simpson
milhouse , i 've never told anyone this kind of thing before ... but i 've never felt this way before . i think i have a crush ...	Lisa Simpson
... on nelson muntz .	Lisa Simpson
but i bet underneath , he 's a sweet , sensitive person -- like you . i guess you could say i want to bring out the milhouse in nelson .	Lisa Simpson
i like you , too , milhouse , but not in that way . you 're more like a big sister .	Lisa Simpson
would you do me a favor ? when you get back to class , just give him this note .	Lisa Simpson
please ?	Lisa Simpson
milhouse , i 'm so sorry ...	Lisa Simpson
nelson ! um ... that note milhouse gave you ... it was n't from him . it was from ... me .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know why i like you . i just do . so ... what do you think ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... would you like to come over to my house after school ?	Lisa Simpson

please do n't ruin this for me , bart . i think he 's starting to like me !	Lisa Simpson
milhouse likes you .	Bart Simpson
oh , please . milhouse likes vaseline on toast .	Lisa Simpson

`` nuke the whales ? '' you do n't really believe that , do you ?	Lisa Simpson
touchã© .	Lisa Simpson

i wish i could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated .	Lisa Simpson
hardly .	Lisa Simpson
how am i supposed to get home ?	Lisa Simpson
i feel so stupid , mom . nelson 's not right for me at all . and i do n't think he ever will be .	Lisa Simpson
well , most women will tell you that you 're a fool to think you can change a man ... but those women are quitters !	Marge Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
when i first met your father , he was loud , crude , and piggish . but i worked hard on him , and now he 's a whole new person !	Marge Simpson
mom ...	Lisa Simpson
he 's a whole new person , lisa !	Marge Simpson
oh , i know .	Lisa Simpson
i wonder if i could change nelson ...	Lisa Simpson
very sharp !	Lisa Simpson
i know it 's a change , but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side .	Lisa Simpson
is n't it nice up here ? what are you thinking , nelson ?	Lisa Simpson
about anything .	Lisa Simpson
what do you feel ? what 's inside you right now ?	Lisa Simpson
come on , nelson ! you must think and feel things . i mean , look where we are : a rolling green hillside , the stars coming out like god is lighting a million tiny candles , the moon looking down on us as if to say ...	Lisa Simpson
see , you do have a tender side . you just needed someone to bring it out .	Lisa Simpson
listen , you thugs , stop making fun of him or you 'll be sorry !	Lisa Simpson
you 'll be so sorry when you realize how you 've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man !	Lisa Simpson
he 's not like you anymore ! he 's changed ! and he does n't want to hang around with a buncha crumb-bums !	Lisa Simpson
you got rid of them ! and you did it like a gentleman , without any violence .	Lisa Simpson
will you two shut up ? ! people are trying to sleep ! !	Homer Simpson
lisa 's window is the next one !	Homer Simpson
shut up ! !	Homer Simpson
that 's so unfair !	Lisa Simpson
meet me at the back door !	Lisa Simpson
ooh , a rubik 's cube . let 's all work it together .	Marge Simpson
hey , who shot the auto-dialer ? marge 's auto-dialer ?	Homer Simpson
i think they 're giving up .	Lisa Simpson
i thought you were n't there .	Lisa Simpson
you lied to me .	Lisa Simpson
there , you did it again !	Lisa Simpson
no . you do n't understand , nelson . a kiss does n't mean anything if it 's dishonest .	Lisa Simpson
i was foolish to think i 'd actually changed you . maybe i was seeing things in you that were n't really there .	Lisa Simpson
then why did you want to be with me ?	Lisa Simpson
well , i guess this is it ...	Lisa Simpson
let 's just call it `` smell ya later . ''	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry . nelson and i do n't like each other anymore .	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm really not thinking about that now .	Lisa Simpson
i suppose it could be almost anybody ...	Lisa Simpson
hmm , pressure dropping , humidity rising over eighty percent , increasing wind ...	Lisa Simpson
here we are , chapter two : `` so your pressure is dropping . '' --	Lisa Simpson
dad , wake up !	Lisa Simpson
... is it ... wah ?	Homer Simpson
i think a hurricane is coming !	Lisa Simpson
oh , lisa , there 's no record of a hurricane ever hitting springfield .	Homer Simpson
yes , but the records only go back to 1978 , when the hall of records was mysteriously blown away !	Lisa Simpson
what is it , boy ? fire ? earthquake ? hippies ?	Homer Simpson
hurricane ! somehow the animals are always the first to know .	Homer Simpson
it 's true , but he should n't say it .	Marge Simpson
we better pick up some supplies .	Lisa Simpson
okay , start with diagonal colors .	Lisa Simpson
oh , there 's so little left : creamed eels ? corn nog ? wadded beef ?	Marge Simpson
mo-om , let 's just grab what we can and get out of here . this storm is making people crazy .	Lisa Simpson
but i 'm not fruit ! i 'm a kid !	Lisa Simpson
oh , i 'm sure i 'd be a third wheel .	Homer Simpson
i would make it my business to be a third wheel .	Homer Simpson
okay , it 's the standard grampa drill . everybody into the cellar !	Homer Simpson
why do n't we do something to take our minds off the storm ?	Marge Simpson
use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it .	Homer Simpson
my main finger ?	Marge Simpson
you 've got to start backwards ! / orange to orange ! ignore the reds ! / alternate corners ! /	Lisa Simpson
one at a time .	Marge Simpson
spin the middle side topwise . topwise .	Bart Simpson
now i remember why i put	Marge Simpson
this down here in the first place !	Marge Simpson
it 's dying down !	Marge Simpson
all clear , everyone .	Homer Simpson
dad , no ! this may just be the eye of the hurricane .	Lisa Simpson

hope you like it , neighbor . we did n't have the best tools or all the know-how , but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love .	Homer Simpson
the living and dining rooms ... with a lovely flow for entertaining ...	Homer Simpson
eh , one out of twenty-five ai n't bad .	Homer Simpson
your beautiful kitchen , ned . just as you remember it .	Homer Simpson
lisa and i built your room .	Bart Simpson

past instances in which i professed to like you were fraudulent .	Homer Simpson
i engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other . now that 's psychiatry ! eh ? eh ?	Homer Simpson
aw , that 's it . you just ca n't insult this guy . you call him a moron and he just sits there , grinning moronly .	Homer Simpson
you know what your problem is , flanders ? you 're afraid to be human .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
because humans are obnoxious sometimes . humans hate things .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , flanders . there 's got to be something you hate . what about mosquito bites ?	Homer Simpson
what about , uh , fluorescent lights ?	Homer Simpson
see ? you like everything .	Homer Simpson
ned , you so crazy .	Homer Simpson
oh , why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper ? `` world '' ... `` the arts '' ... `` religion '' aha ! here it is : `` kickin ' back ! ''	Homer Simpson
hey , who cut something out of my paper ?	Homer Simpson
not me .	Lisa Simpson
not me . i 'm more of a mail-tamperer .	Bart Simpson
homer , i happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face .	Marge Simpson
well , do n't look at me ... just because i 'm holding a pair of scissors . scissors which i need ... to uh ... to gussy-up these curtains .	Marge Simpson
hello ? oh , hi , lenny ... no . why would i need a ride this afternoon ?	Homer Simpson

oh ... kay . i think i 'm gon na be leaving now .	Homer Simpson
huh ? sunrise , sunset ... sunrise , sunset ... sunrise , sunset / sunrise , sunset ...	Homer Simpson
note to self : stop doing anything .	Homer Simpson

you 're just mad cause there 's no clock in your hat .	Bart Simpson
what hat ?	Lisa Simpson
aw , this baby 's wasted on an idiot like you . where 's homer ?	Bart Simpson
your father decided he 'd rather come home in a taxi . or a police car .	Marge Simpson
marge ! thank god you 're here ! where 's the car ?	Homer Simpson
marge ? marge ? oh , now what ? if you 're still mad at me , i 'm gon na be really mad .	Homer Simpson
aw , i hate this place ! why am i here ? !	Homer Simpson
who said that ?	Homer Simpson
hiya .	Homer Simpson
if it 's about laying off the insanity peppers , i 'm way ahead of you .	Homer Simpson
yeah , that 's me all right .	Homer Simpson
but what should i do ? should i meditate ? should i get rid of all my possessions ?	Homer Simpson
you know , i have been meaning to take a spiritual journey , and i would -- hey ! !	Homer Simpson
knock it off !	Homer Simpson
look , just gim me some inner peace , or i 'll mop the floor with ya .	Homer Simpson
soul mate ?	Homer Simpson
that 's it ? well , that 's marge . big deal . great spiritual quest , wolfie . my soul mate is marge .	Homer Simpson
hey , wait ! come back ! ...	Homer Simpson
a ghost train ! and so little time to get out of the way ! ... now less ! ... now none !	Homer Simpson
wha ? golf course ? did i dream that whole thing ? maybe the desert was just this sand trap ... oh , and i bet that crazy pyramid was just the pro shop !	Homer Simpson
carl ?	Homer Simpson
and that talking coyote was really just a talking dog .	Homer Simpson
hey , wait a minute . there 's no such thing as a talking dog .	Homer Simpson
damn straight .	Homer Simpson
so then i says to mabel , i says ...	Bart Simpson
hi , kids .	Homer Simpson
i 'll finish this later . hi , dad .	Bart Simpson
where 's your mother ?	Homer Simpson
out back .	Lisa Simpson
so anyway , i says to mabel , i says ...	Bart Simpson
hi , honey .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh . i guess you 're cranky because i did n't come home last night ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm `` cranky '' because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town . you broke your promise , homer .	Marge Simpson
oh , honey , i did n't get drunk . i just went to a strange fantasy world . c'mon , you got ta believe me . you 're my soul mate .	Homer Simpson
do n't `` soul mate '' me !	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
that coyote said my soul mate would understand me , but marge does n't understand me at all . maybe we 're not kindred spirits . we do n't have anything in common ...	Homer Simpson
look at these records ! jim nabors , glen campbell , the doodletown pipers ! now look at her records ... they stink ! maybe i had that crazy dream for a reason ...	Homer Simpson
wherever my soul mate is , it 's not here .	Homer Simpson
... i always just figured my wife was my soul mate . but if it 's not marge , then who is it ? where do i begin looking ?	Homer Simpson
hey , barney ! soul mate ! let me buy you a beer .	Homer Simpson
well what about you , lenny ?	Homer Simpson
hello ? is this g-b-m ? uh , yeah . i read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and , well , i also like rainy days and movies . uh huh ... uh , no , i do n't like that . or that . no , it 's not that i 'm afraid . i 'm gon na hang up now . bye-bye . oh , i give up .	Homer Simpson
where ? where ? !	Homer Simpson
huh . what 's that blinking light ?	Homer Simpson
the lighthouse keeper !	Homer Simpson
the loneliest man in the world ! he 'll understand me !	Homer Simpson
earl . my new friend 's name is earl !	Homer Simpson
here i come , buddy ! no more loneliness for homer and earl ... .	Homer Simpson
a machine ? earl 's a machine . oh , that 's just perfect ! homer 's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot ! oh , wow !	Homer Simpson
hey , look ! is that dad ?	Bart Simpson
either that or batman has really let himself go .	Lisa Simpson
alone ! i 'm alone ! i 'm a lonely , insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold , indifferent sun !	Homer Simpson
a ship ! a ship with people ! i know ... i 'll bring them to me ! and then they 'll have to be my friends !	Homer Simpson
come here , people !	Homer Simpson
well , i wo n't be lonely for long ... .	Homer Simpson
oh , homer , thank goodness you 're safe !	Marge Simpson
marge ?	Homer Simpson
i woke up and you were n't there , and i was so worried ...	Marge Simpson
really ? you were ? but how did you find me ?	Homer Simpson
well , i was sure you 'd be on foot , because you always say public transportation is for losers . and i was sure you 'd head west , because springfield slopes down that way . and then i saw the lighthouse , and i remembered how you love blinking lights ... like the one on the waffle iron ...	Marge Simpson
or that little guy on the `` do n't walk '' sign .	Homer Simpson
yeah .	Marge Simpson
wow , marge , you really do understand me . see , i thought we were n't soul mates because ...	Homer Simpson
... we had a fight ?	Marge Simpson
right , and we do n't like the same things . it 's like you 're from venus ...	Homer Simpson
... and you 're from mars .	Marge Simpson
oh , sure . give me the one with all the monsters .	Homer Simpson
homer , do n't you see ? our differences are only skin-deep ...	Marge Simpson
... but our sames go right down to the bone . maybe we do have a ...	Homer Simpson
... a profound mystical understanding ?	Marge Simpson
hey ... we do ! oh , marge !	Homer Simpson
we 're number one ! we 're number one ! in your face , space coyote !	Homer Simpson
space coyote ?	Marge Simpson
omigod ! the ship !	Homer Simpson
we 'll all be killed !	Marge Simpson
the light ! we got ta get the light back on !	Homer Simpson
they see us ! they 're starting to turn !	Homer Simpson
we did it !	Marge Simpson
we sure did ... soul mate .	Homer Simpson
tgif ! guys , i 'm off to moe 's .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , i have a plan . i saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city , keeping its speed over fifty , and if its speed dropped , it would explode . i think it was called `` the bus that could n't slow down . '' first , i hook this common vcr into the security camera system like so ...	Homer Simpson
then , i insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop ...	Homer Simpson
bad dog !	Marge Simpson
bad cat !	Marge Simpson
bad fawn ! hmm . shoo ! shoo !	Marge Simpson

have you been drinking ?	Marge Simpson
no ! well , ten beers ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm telling you , i saw a creature from another planet .	Homer Simpson
maybe you just dreamed it .	Lisa Simpson
oh , yeah ? well , when i came to , i was covered with a sticky translucent goo ! explain that !	Homer Simpson
more sausage ?	Marge Simpson
dad , according to `` junior skeptic magazine '' the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours .	Lisa Simpson
so ?	Homer Simpson
it 's just that the people who claim they 've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs ! oh , and you , dad . heh heh ...	Lisa Simpson
i am the thing from uranus !	Bart Simpson
oh . it 's bart . i ca n't believe it . i 'm being mocked ... by my own children ... on my birthday !	Homer Simpson

we love you boy !	Bart Simpson
good doggy . good doggy !	Marge Simpson
lousy loveable dog .	Homer Simpson
oh , it was awful . they set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait , that was my physical .	Homer Simpson
the alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like urkel ! and he appears every friday night -- like urkel !	Homer Simpson
you do n't have to humiliate me .	Homer Simpson
hello , can i help you ?	Marge Simpson
i-is this about that pen that i took from the post office ? i-i swear i did n't know i put it in my purse . then i was going to bring it back , but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse ...	Marge Simpson
oh . come . come in .	Marge Simpson
no , i 'm sorry .	Homer Simpson
yes .	Homer Simpson
ow .	Homer Simpson
well , the evening began at the gentleman 's club , where we were discussing wittgenstein over a game of backgammon .	Homer Simpson
we were sitting in barney 's car eating packets of mustard . ya happy ?	Homer Simpson
you are one fine-lookin ' woman , lady . if i was n't married , i 'd go out with you like that .	Homer Simpson
i am so sorry . whatever you do , do n't tell marge . god , i love her . i -- hey , a penny !	Homer Simpson
so i says `` blue m & m , red m & m , they all wind up the same color in the end . ''	Homer Simpson
i was standing right here , when the horrible creature emerged from the woods .	Homer Simpson
oh , marge , i 've never felt so alone . no one believes me . uh , this is the part where you 're supposed to say `` i believe you , homer . ''	Homer Simpson
i do n't believe you , homer .	Marge Simpson
you do ? ! oh , marge , you 've made me so happy !	Homer Simpson
you 're not listening . you 're only hearing what you want to hear .	Marge Simpson
thanks ! i 'd love an omelet right about now .	Homer Simpson
homer , please ! i try to be supportive , but this has gone too far . please just let it be .	Marge Simpson
no , i ca n't . this is my cause . i 'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon . what was his name ? apollo creed ?	Homer Simpson
please , let 's just go to sleep .	Marge Simpson
no , i refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks i 'm crazy . unless you 're feeling ... amorous ?	Homer Simpson
no , i 'm not .	Marge Simpson
well then , good night !	Homer Simpson
hey , dad . what 's the word from planet crackpot ?	Bart Simpson

yes , i do . you seem so damn sure .	Bart Simpson
thank you , son . and do you think you could stop the casual swearing ?	Homer Simpson
hell , yes .	Bart Simpson
that 's my boy . well , if you believe in me , then i 'm not going to give up . i 'll prove i 'm right . this friday we 're going back to the woods , and we 're going to find that alien !	Homer Simpson
what if we do n't ?	Bart Simpson
we 'll fake it and sell it to the fox network .	Homer Simpson
they 'll buy anything !	Bart Simpson
now son , they do a lot of quality programming , too .	Homer Simpson
i kill me .	Homer Simpson
yo , dad , can i have a sip of your beer ?	Bart Simpson
now , son , you do n't want to drink beer . that 's for daddies , and kids with fake ids ... besides , it 's such a beautiful night . how about a ghost story ?	Homer Simpson
and that is how much college will cost for maggie !	Bart Simpson
no ! no ! no-o-o-o-o !	Homer Simpson
you know , dad , it does n't matter that we did n't see the alien . i 've really had a great time out here .	Bart Simpson

good work , son ! we did it ! we did it !	Homer Simpson
marge ! kids ! they 're about to show my videotape !	Homer Simpson
well , lis , what do you think about the alien now ?	Bart Simpson
i think there must be a more logical explanation . and i think the people of this town are n't gon na be won over by three seconds of videotape .	Lisa Simpson
uh , i 'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien . any questions at all . doctor hibbert ?	Homer Simpson

thanks , marge .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not wild about these high-risk ventures . they sound a little risky .	Marge Simpson
i guess i 'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of `` investing '' ...	Marge Simpson
all right , helen , if i 'm not wanted , i 'll leave .	Marge Simpson
... and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club .	Marge Simpson
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait -- back up a bit now . when are the pancakes coming in the mail ?	Homer Simpson
well , maybe it 's all for the best ...	Marge Simpson
what do you need to make money for anyway ? as long as i have my earning power , this family 's got nothing to worry about .	Homer Simpson
ow ! oh ! call work and tell 'em i wo n't be in tomorrow .	Homer Simpson
mom , this is no time to be conservative . let 's roll the dice here .	Lisa Simpson
it would be nice to beat those women at their own game . maybe i should look into a franchise .	Marge Simpson
well , we 're trying to , but you 're blocking our way .	Marge Simpson
i 'll handle this .	Bart Simpson
no deal , mccutcheon . that moon money is mine !	Homer Simpson
now you 're the one who 's being naive .	Marge Simpson

mmm ... hmm ... that 's not bad .	Marge Simpson
wooo ! we 're number one ! we 're number one !	Bart Simpson
hey , what 's going on ? ! wait , wait ! hey , let go of me ! ...	Bart Simpson
your franchise , how much ?	Marge Simpson

i should 've said `` limit -- one per customer . ''	Marge Simpson
`` hang in there , baby . '' you said it , kitty . copyright 1968 ? hmm . determined or not , that cat must be long dead . that 's kind of a downer .	Marge Simpson

oh , mom , no !	Lisa Simpson

oh , oh , you have to push in as you turn .	Marge Simpson
yeah , that 's it .	Marge Simpson

homer , did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder ?	Marge Simpson
in those words ? yes .	Homer Simpson
oh , it just sickens me . how could you do this to someone you love ?	Marge Simpson
how could i not ? i saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere . i saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into america 's already bloated snack-hole . so i did what i could . i did what any loving husband would do : i reached out to some violent mobsters .	Homer Simpson
oh , homer , i know you were trying to shield me from failure , but this is my business , and the mafia 's not getting one cent of my money !	Marge Simpson
so what are we gon na do ?	Homer Simpson
we 're going to do what we do every day . we 're going to make pretzels .	Marge Simpson

you must hate me , marge . every time i try to help , i just fail miserably .	Homer Simpson

sharing is a bunch of bull too . and helping others . and what 's all this crap i 've been hearing about tolerance ?	Bart Simpson

ma , i need a glass of milk .	Bart Simpson
me too .	Lisa Simpson
i was just with dr. hibbert . he said i was under a lot of stress and should get some help .	Marge Simpson
marge , whatever it takes to make you well , we 'll do it .	Homer Simpson
well ... i was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out .	Marge Simpson
a nanny ? !	Bart Simpson
but how am i supposed to pay for that ?	Homer Simpson
we 'll find a way . mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it 's time we gave up something for her . i 'll stop buying malibu stacey clothing .	Lisa Simpson
and i 'll take up smoking and give that up .	Bart Simpson
good for you , son . giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you 'll ever have to do . have a dollar .	Homer Simpson
but he did n't do anything !	Lisa Simpson
did n't he lisa ? did n't he ? hey , wait a minute , he did n't !	Homer Simpson
homie , please , i never ask for much , but this is something i really need .	Marge Simpson
all right , marge . i 'll get you your nanny , and to pay for it ... i 'll give up the civil war re-creation society i love so much .	Homer Simpson

shh . tv .	Lisa Simpson
oh , that poor woman .	Homer Simpson
we 've crushed her gentle spirit .	Lisa Simpson
you people should be ashamed of yourselves .	Bart Simpson
shary , you did the best you could . but you ca n't change this family . neither can i. from now on i 'm just gon na sit back and enjoy the ride .	Marge Simpson
nope .	Homer Simpson
nope .	Lisa Simpson
nope .	Bart Simpson
nope .	Marge Simpson
indubitably !	Homer Simpson
around the house , i never lift a finger / as a husband and father i 'm sub-par / i 'd rather drink a beer than win father of the year / i 'm happy with things the way they are .	Homer Simpson
i 'm getting used to never getting noticed .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm stuck here till i can steal a car .	Bart Simpson
the house is still a mess and i 'm going bald from stress --	Marge Simpson

kids ? kids ?	Marge Simpson
you 're missing the itchy and scratchy show ! do n't you like it anymore ?	Marge Simpson
sure , we love it ! but how can we watch tv when it 's so beautiful out ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , mom . i mean , we love you and dad too , but god knows we do n't need to see you every day .	Bart Simpson
an occasional hug is all i ask .	Marge Simpson
mo-om , you can hug me when i 'm asleep .	Bart Simpson
i do .	Marge Simpson
i need to purchase a brassiere . you kids wait over here in the credit department .	Marge Simpson

mmm ... okay . just be careful .	Marge Simpson
ok. / guess so . / sounds good to me./ let 's go .	Lisa Simpson
wow ! / alright ! / cool !	Lisa Simpson
why is that mirror sneezing ?	Lisa Simpson
me ! / i would ! /	Lisa Simpson
me ! / i would ! /	Lisa Simpson
um , excuse me , sir . the thing is , there 's not really anything wrong with the itchy and scratchy show -- it 's as good as ever . but after so many years , the characters just ca n't have the same impact they once had .	Lisa Simpson
adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings .	Lisa Simpson
'morning , roy !	Marge Simpson
yeah , hi , roy . hey , they 're having open casting for the voice of poochie .	Homer Simpson
you should try out , dad . you have a funny voice .	Lisa Simpson
i do not !	Homer Simpson
have n't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder ?	Bart Simpson
i prefer to listen to cheap trick .	Homer Simpson
well , here . say something .	Bart Simpson
hey , this is homer simpson sayin ' `` howdy '' to all the girls out there in radioland .	Homer Simpson
hey , this is homer simpson sayin ' -- i do n't sound like that , do i ? oh , i do n't like having such a hilarious voice .	Homer Simpson
that hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom .	Bart Simpson
ruff ruff ! i 'm poochie the rockin ' dog .	Homer Simpson
oh , `` no attitude , '' eh ? not `` in-your-face , '' huh ? well , you can cram it with walnuts , ugly !	Homer Simpson
huh ? i ca n't . i do n't remember what i did .	Homer Simpson
oh , i do n't get the job , do i ? well , boo-hoo , i do n't get to be a cartoon dog .	Homer Simpson
oh , now i got the job , huh ? oh . thank you .	Homer Simpson
she smells sheet smells by the sheet store . wait , wait . lem me try it again .	Homer Simpson
you ? but you 're a lady .	Homer Simpson
hey , it really is you ! how 'd you get to be so good ?	Homer Simpson
you mean `` meep meep '' ?	Homer Simpson
uh , i guess . is this episode going on the air live ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll field this one . let me ask you a question : why would a man whose shirt says `` genius at work '' spend all of his time watching a children 's cartoon show ?	Homer Simpson
what the hell are you talking about ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm so glad you could join us for homer 's big premiere .	Marge Simpson
i 'm not a girl ! are you blind ?	Bart Simpson
shush everybody ! it 's coming on !	Marge Simpson
quiet ! you 're missing the jokes !	Homer Simpson
well ? what did everybody think ?	Homer Simpson
so it was pretty okay , huh ?	Homer Simpson
mom , can we go to bed without dinner ?	Bart Simpson
yes we can !	Marge Simpson
well , at least i liked it . did n't i ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm the worst poochie ever .	Homer Simpson
no , it 's not your fault , dad . you did fine . it 's just that poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking . you ca n't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords .	Lisa Simpson
do n't have a cow , lis .	Bart Simpson
bart 's right -- let 's none of us have a cow . all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it .	Marge Simpson
hey , i know it was n't great , but what right do you have to complain ?	Bart Simpson
what ? they 've given you thousands of	Bart Simpson
hours of entertainment for free . what could they possibly owe you ? i mean , if anything , you owe them .	Bart Simpson
then they said they were gon na kill poochie off !	Homer Simpson
really ? ! oh , how terrible !	Bart Simpson
yes . terrible .	Lisa Simpson
it 's not your fault , homer . it 's those lousy writers . they make me madder than a , um ... yak in heat !	Marge Simpson
you 're right , marge ! it 's not my fault ! i 'm not gon na let 'em treat poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he 's the new guy !	Homer Simpson
put a sock in it , roy .	Homer Simpson
no i am not .	Homer Simpson
never !	Homer Simpson
you ca n't just kill off a classic tv character . poochie could be bigger than curly fries , but first he has to win back the audience . that 's why i 'm gon na read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands .	Homer Simpson
yes . i certainly do . hello there , itchy . i know there 's a lot of people who do n't like me and wish i would go away , but i think we got off on the wrong foot . i know i can come off a little proactive , and for that i 'm sorry . but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted , i know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together .	Homer Simpson
now , kids -- i know you loved the old poochie ... but the new one 's going to be better than ten superbowls . i do n't want to oversell it . judge for yourselves .	Homer Simpson
so ?	Marge Simpson
wow -- poochie came from another planet ?	Bart Simpson
i guess ...	Lisa Simpson
hey , that was n't supposed to happen ! those finks double-crossed me !	Homer Simpson
tough break , dad . i guess people just were n't ready for poochie . maybe in a few years .	Bart Simpson
oh , then i guess this is goodbye , roy . maybe we 'll see you in a few years ...	Marge Simpson
well , i guess i learned my lesson . the thing is , i lost creative control of the project . and i forgot to ask for any money . well , live and learn .	Homer Simpson
it 's back to the basics . classic itchy and scratchy !	Bart Simpson
we should thank our lucky stars they 're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years .	Lisa Simpson
what else is on ?	Bart Simpson
all right , everybody got their ticket ? then get ready for today 's super-barto jackpot drawing !	Bart Simpson
aannd 'round and 'round she -- uh-oh .	Bart Simpson
no refunds ! force majeure ! read the back of your ticket !	Bart Simpson
nine hundred dollars ? well , we 'll have to dip into the retirement fund again .	Homer Simpson
aw , nuts . hel-lo ? china ? little help ?	Homer Simpson
well , i never thought it would come to this , but i guess we 'll have to sell grandma 's civil war doll .	Marge Simpson
aw , mom , are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill ? i mean , what would your grandma say ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sure she 'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm , dry underwear .	Marge Simpson
that is so true .	Homer Simpson
hey , lis , check it out ! pogo stilts ! these were banned in all 50 states !	Bart Simpson
what happened ?	Homer Simpson
wow ! an actual robot from the movie `` clank ! clank ! you 're dead ! ''	Lisa Simpson
ech ! think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside ...	Lisa Simpson
aw , boo hoo . that 's what they get paid for .	Bart Simpson
oh , homer , look ! look ! a tv guide owned by jackie o. !	Marge Simpson
give her a break ! her husband was killed !	Homer Simpson
yes , i have something that i 'd like to sell .	Marge Simpson
please do n't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery .	Lisa Simpson
oh , no . oh , no , no , no , no . no . it 's a very , very old figurine .	Marge Simpson
okay , so maybe that thing 's a hunk of junk , but look at what you 're selling !	Homer Simpson
fifty bucks for a toy ? no kid is worth that .	Homer Simpson
no . how can you love a box , or a toy , or graphics ? you 're a grown man .	Homer Simpson
oh , yeah . like when a clown dies .	Homer Simpson
and that kind of stuff is worth money ?	Homer Simpson
man , you should come over to our place . it 's full of valuable , worthless crap !	Homer Simpson
i practically insist . shall we say , 5 o'clock ? the snacking hour ?	Homer Simpson
... pimento nose ... and voila ! mommy 's patented happy-cracker snack platter !	Marge Simpson
do i know you ?	Homer Simpson
hi-c ! and fluffernutters !	Lisa Simpson
not really . they just had corn on them . kitchen -- corn .	Marge Simpson
ow ! why you little ...	Homer Simpson
dad ! dad ! company ! company !	Bart Simpson
oh . i 'll just be another minute , john . have a seat .	Homer Simpson
so , do those records have `` camp value ? ''	Homer Simpson
mom , john likes `` itchy and scratchy '' as much as we do -- maybe more !	Lisa Simpson
yeah , and he collects toy robots !	Bart Simpson
he is quite a charmer . your father 's certainly taken a shine to him ...	Marge Simpson
that john is the greatest guy in the world . we 've got ta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime .	Homer Simpson
mmm , i do n't think he 's married , homer .	Marge Simpson
oh , a swinging bachelor , eh ? well , there 's lots of foxy ladies out there ...	Homer Simpson
homer , did n't john seem a little ... festive to you ?	Marge Simpson
could n't agree more . happy as a clam .	Homer Simpson
he prefers the company of men !	Marge Simpson
who does n't ?	Homer Simpson
homer , listen carefully : john is a ho-mo --	Marge Simpson
right ...	Homer Simpson
... sexual .	Marge Simpson
ohmygod ! ohmygod ! ohmygod ! ohmygod ! i danced with a gay ! marge , lisa , promise me you wo n't tell anyone . promise me !	Homer Simpson
you 're being ridiculous .	Marge Simpson
am i , marge ? am i ? think of the property values ! now we can never say only straight people have been in this house !	Homer Simpson
i 'm very sorry you feel that way . because john invited us all out for a drive today , and we 're going .	Marge Simpson
whoa , not me . and not because john 's gay , but because he 's a sneak . he should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he 's that way .	Homer Simpson
what on earth are you talking about ?	Marge Simpson
you know me , marge : i like my beer cold , my tv loud , and my homosexuals fla-ming .	Homer Simpson
homer , at least come out and say hello .	Marge Simpson
no ! no , no , no , no ...	Homer Simpson
come on . you liked john this morning .	Marge Simpson
no , no ! i 'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone !	Homer Simpson
oh , dad , you are the living end .	Bart Simpson
hey , where 'd that cool creepy santa come from ?	Bart Simpson
that was a killer tour , man .	Bart Simpson
i never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard !	Lisa Simpson
how 'd it go ? tell me everything that happened ! he did n't give you gay , did he ? did he ?	Homer Simpson
oh , geez louise , you do n't even know what you 're worried about anymore . john 's a witty , urbane person .	Marge Simpson
oh , and i 'm not .	Homer Simpson
hey , dad , look what i got ! zzzapp ! ! zzzapp ! zzzapp ! zzzapp !	Bart Simpson
bart ! where 'd you get that shirt ?	Homer Simpson
i'unno . came outta the closet .	Bart Simpson
uhh ... huh .	Homer Simpson
i hope you all saved room , because i made your favorite dessert : store-bought snack cakes ! both kinds !	Marge Simpson
homie , i can hear you chewing on your pillow . what 's wrong ?	Marge Simpson
marge , the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt !	Homer Simpson
there 's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys , and big fat party-animals . and bart does n't look like a big fat party-animal to me .	Homer Simpson
so if you wore a hawaiian shirt , it would n't be gay ?	Marge Simpson
right . thank you . i hope you realize this is all your fault . i mean , do you have to be so effeminate around the boy ?	Homer Simpson
homer , i do n't think there 's a problem with bart . but if there is , it 's probably because you 're not spending any time with him . goodnight .	Marge Simpson
gon na what , homer ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't , but i loved hearing it !	Marge Simpson
you ! i should have known !	Homer Simpson
homer , john brought us cactus candy !	Marge Simpson
look , john , you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all . just stay the hell away from my family !	Homer Simpson

hang onto it , toy-boy ! you might need it when it starts raining naked ladies !	Homer Simpson
you guys gon na teach me to drive ?	Bart Simpson
no , boy . you ca n't drive , you 're only 10. you 're going hunting !	Homer Simpson
nope . something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods ... seems kinda gay .	Bart Simpson
that is a very immature attitude , young man .	Homer Simpson
well ... but ... wait a minute . bart 's not fixed yet ! he has n't even --	Homer Simpson
oh , she 'd never go . she 's a vegetarian .	Homer Simpson
no ... this whole thing is my fault . i 've been a lousy dad .	Homer Simpson
no . they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it .	Lisa Simpson
but if there 're no deer out there , then what are they hunting ?	Lisa Simpson
hey , boy , wake up ! your old man found some deer !	Homer Simpson
huh ? you did ? wait , man , those are reindeer .	Bart Simpson
yep , and it 's your shot , son .	Homer Simpson

hey , we owe this guy . and i do n't want you calling him a sissy . this guy 's a fruit ! and a -- no , wait , wait , wait -- `` queer ! '' queer , queer . that 's what you like to be called , right ?	Homer Simpson
this is about as tolerant as dad gets , so you should be flattered .	Lisa Simpson
amen to that .	Homer Simpson
y'know , bart , maybe it 's just the concussion talking , but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Bart Simpson
he thinks you 're gay .	Lisa Simpson
he thinks i 'm gay ?	Bart Simpson
man , those cons love krusty . inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy .	Bart Simpson
and vice versa .	Lisa Simpson
just remember , bart , convicts are n't `` cool . '' they 're bad people .	Marge Simpson
yeah , maybe so . but they get the job done .	Bart Simpson
he said `` tried '' !	Homer Simpson
someone should really go up there and talk to him .	Marge Simpson
ho-mer .	Marge Simpson
oh , all those stairs ...	Homer Simpson
oh , you have nothing to worry about , honey .	Marge Simpson
your mother 's right , bart . sure , you 're the one who ruined all of sideshow bob 's criminal schemes --	Homer Simpson
we 're very proud of you , by the way .	Marge Simpson
and sure , he 's probably so insane with rage that he 'd butcher you horribly if he could --	Homer Simpson
but he 's safely locked away !	Marge Simpson
in a medium-security prison .	Homer Simpson
for life !	Marge Simpson
unless he gets out somehow .	Homer Simpson
which is impossible !	Marge Simpson
or so you 'd think , except he 's done it so many times before .	Homer Simpson
thanks for trying , guys , but sideshow bob wants me dead , and sideshow bob is an unstoppable killing machine .	Bart Simpson
how can you even think of releasing sideshow bob ?	Marge Simpson
he 's just faking it to get out of jail ! he 's a maniac !	Bart Simpson
do n't you see what you 've done ? sideshow bob has n't reformed ! he 's pure evil ! oh , if only you knew what he was thinking ...	Bart Simpson
and god bless mom and dad and lisa and maggie , and please , god , kill sideshow bob --	Bart Simpson
bart , no !	Marge Simpson
it 's him or me , o lord !	Bart Simpson
you ca n't ask god to kill someone !	Marge Simpson
yeah ! you do your own dirty work !	Homer Simpson
he 's planning something evil , i know it . it must have something to do with the town 's water supply .	Bart Simpson
um ... nah , that 's not his style .	Bart Simpson
mrs. krabappel , nooo ! that 's sideshow bob !	Bart Simpson
i wo n't be happy until i find out what you 're up to . wherever you go and whatever you do , i 'll be there watching and waiting .	Bart Simpson
hey , you said we were going to dairy queen .	Lisa Simpson
i lied . now help me rummage through bob 's trash for clues . then i promise we 'll go to the water slide .	Bart Simpson
lisa too ?	Homer Simpson
well , i hope bob fed you , 'cause i ate your dinners .	Homer Simpson
i know it 's hard to accept , bart , but face it : sideshow bob has changed .	Lisa Simpson
no , he has n't . he 's more the same than ever . and i know where the evidence is . there 's only one place it could possibly be .	Bart Simpson
bob 's trailer at the construction site ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's even better . let 's go there .	Bart Simpson
what were you thinking ?	Lisa Simpson
the haunted mine .	Bart Simpson
blueprints ... concrete invoices ... construction schedule ...	Bart Simpson
if i did n't know better , i 'd swear bob was building a dam .	Lisa Simpson
oh , yeah ? then explain this !	Bart Simpson
bart , there must be millions of dollars there !	Lisa Simpson
what is sideshow bob doing with --	Bart Simpson
i hink he nay have spotted us .	Bart Simpson
run !	Lisa Simpson
give it up , bob . we found the money .	Bart Simpson
then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it .	Lisa Simpson
you cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself ! that 's what happened .	Lisa Simpson
get 'im , lis !	Bart Simpson
but everyone will know you did this !	Lisa Simpson
it 's hopeless . utterly , utterly hopeless .	Lisa Simpson
ah , what the hell .	Bart Simpson
let 's go again ! let 's go again !	Bart Simpson
no !	Lisa Simpson
um , do you know what you 're doing ?	Lisa Simpson
nooo !	Bart Simpson
guess who !	Bart Simpson
bob , look !	Lisa Simpson
by throwing me off a dam ? is n't that a little crude for a genius like you ?	Bart Simpson
bart !	Lisa Simpson
i guess this is it . thanks anyway .	Bart Simpson
do we have to ?	Bart Simpson
yeah ... i guess this means you ca n't ever try to kill me again , huh ?	Bart Simpson
no , chief , bob 's innocent ! it 's the truth !	Lisa Simpson
heh , funny , is n't it , lis ? those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction .	Bart Simpson
marge , i 'm going to look for the kids !	Homer Simpson
oh , that sounds fabulous , homer . stores throw the best parties .	Marge Simpson
you like parties , huh ? well , i just remembered they 're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend .	Homer Simpson
you did n't remember that . you just saw it on tv .	Marge Simpson
the important thing is i did n't imagine it .	Homer Simpson
i love everything about the world of babysitting : the responsibility , the obligation , the pressure ...	Lisa Simpson
that 's a trust , janey . a sacred trust .	Lisa Simpson
all the best bands are affiliated with satan .	Bart Simpson
why has n't anyone called ?	Lisa Simpson
maybe people do n't want an eight-year-old babysitter , honey . parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen . that 's why they hire teenagers .	Marge Simpson
but ... but i 'm very mature for my age . people often mistake me for nine .	Lisa Simpson
militants , huh ? well , if i were you , i 'd kick their asses .	Homer Simpson
uh , gee , i 'd really love to want to help you , flanders , but uh , marge was taken prisoner in the ... holy land and uh ...	Homer Simpson
i 'll do it ! i 'll babysit !	Lisa Simpson
but i 'm smart and responsible , and my parents will be right next door !	Lisa Simpson
please , please , please !	Lisa Simpson
i 'll have to ask her .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry . a moth is no more harmful than a ladybug .	Lisa Simpson
oh , they 're going to get eaten alive in middle school .	Lisa Simpson
once there was a robot named todd ...	Lisa Simpson
yes , he had a brother robot named rod , who was two space-years older than him .	Lisa Simpson
okay , chief . enjoy bob saget !	Lisa Simpson
now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you 're done .	Lisa Simpson
hey , dad , how come you 're wearing a tuxedo ?	Bart Simpson
going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow .	Homer Simpson
why you wearing it now ?	Bart Simpson
oh , it 's like a rent-a-car , son . you get all the mileage you can . then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot .	Homer Simpson
thanks for the ride !	Lisa Simpson
thank you , dr. hibbert . your trust means so much to me .	Lisa Simpson
you made all that money for sitting around and watching tv and eating food ?	Bart Simpson
man , if i was making that kind of money , i 'd be out of here so fast ...	Bart Simpson
you look so glamorous , mom ! oh , and you smell like vanilla flowers !	Lisa Simpson
and dad , you look totally classy . you could be abe lincoln 's father 's boss !	Bart Simpson
can you see the pie stains ?	Homer Simpson
it 'll be dark .	Lisa Simpson
so when 's grampa getting here to babysit ?	Bart Simpson
uh , grampa 's not coming ...	Marge Simpson
not patty and selma !	Bart Simpson
actually , bart , lisa is going to be in charge tonight .	Marge Simpson
what ? !	Bart Simpson
i know she 's young , but lisa has proven herself mature and dependable .	Marge Simpson
dad , help me out !	Bart Simpson
take it like a man , boy . and do everything your little sister says .	Homer Simpson
this is an outrage ! i am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is ! this is the greatest injustice in the history of the world !	Bart Simpson
well , we have to run . i 'm sure you kids will work things out . good night !	Marge Simpson
make sure he brushes his teeth , lisa .	Marge Simpson
bart , i know you 're not wild about having me for a babysitter , but i 'm not some ogre . i think you will find me fair and fun .	Lisa Simpson
you 're dead .	Bart Simpson
you should wash up for dinner . to make it fun , you can use the mr. bubble -- it 'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath !	Lisa Simpson
you are so dead .	Bart Simpson
aw , i love this pedestrian mall ! there 's practically no traffic !	Homer Simpson
uh , i do n't think we should be driving here . the mayor 's yelling at us .	Marge Simpson
all right , all right , geez . okay , honey , remember where we 're parked .	Homer Simpson
may i have some more lima beans ?	Bart Simpson
certainly .	Lisa Simpson
more than that .	Bart Simpson
certainly .	Lisa Simpson
more .	Bart Simpson
more .	Bart Simpson
more .	Bart Simpson
uh , maybe you should eat the ones you have .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't say i was gon na eat them . i just wanted to look at them , because they 're so gross . what 's for dessert ?	Bart Simpson
bart , if you do n't want to have a babysitter , maybe you should stop being such a baby .	Lisa Simpson
oh , i 'm a baby , huh ? well , then i 'll act like a baby .	Bart Simpson
ga-ga-goo-goo .	Bart Simpson
even babies know how to open and close their mouths . you need a bib .	Lisa Simpson
oh , baby hate bib . waah ! waah !	Bart Simpson
oh , look , bart , now you got maggie all upset !	Lisa Simpson
relax . i 'll give her some ice cream .	Bart Simpson
bart , that 's coffee ice cream ! it has caffeine in it !	Lisa Simpson
well , i guess that 'll make things more interesting for you now , wo n't it ?	Bart Simpson
oh , it 's so beautiful ! this is what i imagine paris must be like !	Marge Simpson
you 've never been ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores . i guess this makes us `` yuppies , '' huh , homie ?	Marge Simpson
nah , i 'm really more of a slacker .	Homer Simpson
oooh , malaria zone ! that 's where all the explorers shop .	Marge Simpson
look , marge ! a restaurant owned by celebrities ! i always wanted to be a celebrity !	Homer Simpson
is n't that clever ? it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building .	Marge Simpson
wow , even moe 's moved to fancy new digs .	Homer Simpson
mag-gie , if you come down , i 'll give you some more cof-fee .	Lisa Simpson
lots more coffee . are you getting ready for bed , bart ?	Lisa Simpson

um , yes , i 'd like to host an a.a. meeting . tonight , if possible .	Bart Simpson
come on , maggie ... good maggie ... the talcum powder 's not to play with ...	Lisa Simpson
okay , bart , now it 's really time for you to go to bed !	Lisa Simpson

i 'll answer it . you go to bed !	Lisa Simpson
what ? i did n't order any giant sub !	Lisa Simpson
excuse me ?	Lisa Simpson
well , there 's been a mistake .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't see any u.f.o . !	Lisa Simpson
well , he 's not here ! nobody 's here ! and none of you should be here ! you 've all been tricked !	Lisa Simpson
bart , you are going to be in so much trouble when mom and dad get home . now go to bed !	Lisa Simpson

yah ! oh , cool , it must be dislocated or something ...	Bart Simpson
we have to get you to the emergency room !	Lisa Simpson
and get this fixed ? what 's the rush ? do n't you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were ?	Bart Simpson

well -- and i can explain , remember -- i fill the balls with beer that i found at the dump , then i bowl them and some underground pipes take them into moe 's .	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's very clever !	Marge Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
mo-om !	Lisa Simpson
well , it is . i 've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he 's ever done . besides , he 's only breaking a silly , two-hundred-year-old law ...	Marge Simpson

dad ! you 're not supposed to have fun recycling . this is serious .	Lisa Simpson
oh , okay .	Homer Simpson

wh -- th -- that 's crazy talk . you 're crazy , marge . get off the road .	Homer Simpson
you 'll have to face him sometime . and when you do , i 'm sure he 'll be just as anxious to make up as you are .	Marge Simpson
no he wo n't . he hates me .	Homer Simpson
he does n't hate you . he just feels insecure because you 're getting through life so easily and it 's been so difficult for him .	Marge Simpson
yeah , yeah , that 's his problem . he 's a nut . it 's not about me being lazy , it 's about him being a crazy nut !	Homer Simpson
well , maybe ... but i 'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more ... professional in your work .	Marge Simpson
just a little more ... then he wo n't have any reason to resent you .	Marge Simpson
i 'll do it . to professionalism !	Homer Simpson
good morning , fellow employee . you 'll notice that i am now a model worker . we should continue this conversation later during the designated break period . sincerely , homer simpson .	Homer Simpson

lenny , tell mr. burns i 've gone home to work on the contest .	Homer Simpson

b-b-before the show , you said we were having a special ghost tonight !	Homer Simpson
i said we were having a special guest tonight -- mr. tim conway .	Marge Simpson
what 's a tim conway ?	Homer Simpson
you know homer , we 've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show .	Marge Simpson
marge , have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers ?	Homer Simpson
yes ! and it might look something like this ...	Marge Simpson
honey , i 'm home !	Homer Simpson
it 's not a plant , marge , it 's a tree , and i 've nearly chewed through it . now remember , my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight .	Homer Simpson
i know . and i made your favorite --	Marge Simpson
stakes !	Marge Simpson
hey , would you two close the dam door ?	Bart Simpson
bart !	Marge Simpson

okay . now , before my boss comes , there 's something important you should know --	Homer Simpson
in a minute , homie . i have to get the door .	Marge Simpson
but , marge ... !	Homer Simpson
inflation , trade deficit , horrible war atrocities ... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world ?	Marge Simpson
well , i know one thing in this world that 's still pure and good .	Homer Simpson
christian love ?	Marge Simpson
no ... candy ! sweet , sweet candy .	Homer Simpson
i want candy !	Homer Simpson
but do n't you want to end world famine ?	Marge Simpson
i want candy !	Bart Simpson
or save the endangered alaskan salmon ?	Marge Simpson
well , if you wo n't think of society 's ills ...	Marge Simpson
i want candy !	Homer Simpson
at least think of our dentist bills !	Marge Simpson
well , it 's time to say `` good night . ''	Marge Simpson
i wish our special guest tim conway did n't have to leave so soon .	Homer Simpson
he 's just kidding . we 'd like to thank fox , and the good people at budget lodge .	Marge Simpson
well , that 's all the time we have . so this is the simpson family saying : `` as you walk down the road of life ... ''	Homer Simpson
hitchhike -- it 's faster !	Bart Simpson
we 're like this all the time !	Marge Simpson
oh , miss hoover , movies are a nice break , but could n't we be doing something a little more challenging ?	Lisa Simpson
where 's miss hoover ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's not my nature to complain , but so far today we 've had three movies , two film strips , and an hour and a half of `` magazine time . '' i just do n't feel challenged .	Lisa Simpson
testing ...	Bart Simpson
testing ...	Bart Simpson
hmm . hmm . hey ...	Bart Simpson
testing ...	Bart Simpson
when do you expect the ringing will stop ? !	Lisa Simpson
now , about your punishment , young man .	Marge Simpson
i know , i 'll go to my room and think about what i did .	Bart Simpson
no , no ! your room is full of toys . you 're going to the , uh , garage !	Homer Simpson
you 're the boss .	Bart Simpson
i tell you , chief , i just do n't know what we 're going to do with him .	Marge Simpson
not very .	Homer Simpson
no ! no drugs . bart just needs a little discipline .	Marge Simpson
you know , maybe chief wiggum is right . military school is a good idea .	Marge Simpson
wow , i ca n't believe we 're going to disneyland ! hey , where 's all your luggage ?	Bart Simpson
military school ? ! you lied to me !	Bart Simpson
well , i 'm sorry if you heard `` disneyland '' , but i distinctly said `` military school . ''	Homer Simpson
well , it certainly was nice of you to accept bart in the middle of the semester .	Marge Simpson
freak-outs ?	Bart Simpson
if , uh , that happens , are we still charged for the entire semester ?	Homer Simpson
look at how disciplined they are . they 're just like the terra cotta warriors of xian .	Lisa Simpson
they sure are .	Homer Simpson
that 's not so disciplined .	Homer Simpson
i guess .	Homer Simpson
well , he sure sucked the fun out of that poem .	Marge Simpson
please do n't make me stay , dad ! i 'll do anything you say ! i 'll find religion ! i 'll be good sometimes !	Bart Simpson
leggo my leg .	Homer Simpson
no !	Bart Simpson
son , for the last time , you 're staying at military school .	Homer Simpson
and so am i !	Lisa Simpson
this school has everything i ever wanted .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , no ! this place is just a jail for children .	Marge Simpson
no jail can hold me !	Bart Simpson
yes .	Lisa Simpson
all i want is a chance to prove myself .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , if you ever want to quit and come home , i 'll be here in half a jiff .	Marge Simpson
i want to quit and come home .	Bart Simpson
i want to quit and come home .	Bart Simpson
oh , honey ... i heard you the first time .	Marge Simpson
sorry . sorry . i know we 'll be friends . talk about getting off on the wrong foot ... heh heh .	Lisa Simpson
is there any answer i can give that wo n't result in more push-ups ?	Lisa Simpson
hey , look , it 's the school motto .	Lisa Simpson
`` i 'll die before i surrender , tim . '' who 's tim ?	Bart Simpson
apparently tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head .	Lisa Simpson
cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything i stand for . i do n't think i can survive here , lis .	Bart Simpson
that 's how they want you to feel . but if you just hang in there , they 'll eventually accept you .	Lisa Simpson
hey , what about me ? i 'm a lowly maggot !	Lisa Simpson
did i ?	Bart Simpson
i am just calling home , i am not asking to come home .	Lisa Simpson
marge ? you got that ? marge ? !	Homer Simpson
hey , go on , boy . go get it ! answer the phone ! be a good boy !	Homer Simpson
oh , there 's got ta be something on this thing for that thing .	Homer Simpson
oh , grampa , you 're not busy are you ?	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh . so , anything else you want to talk about ?	Lisa Simpson
what is it ?	Bart Simpson
bart , i got a cassette from mom and dad ! i thought we could listen to it together .	Lisa Simpson
gee , lis , i 'd love to , but this really is n't a good time ...	Bart Simpson
uh ...	Bart Simpson
lisa . you 're talking to lisa .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm talking to ... no one .	Bart Simpson
... and do n't worry , sweetie , it 's very common to be homesick when you 're so far away from the people who love you .	Marge Simpson
okay . i 'm not gon na give up . solitude never hurt anyone . emily dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known ! and went crazy as a loon .	Lisa Simpson
`` you are my sunshine , my only sunshine / you make me happy , when skies are gray / you 'll never know , dear / how much i love you / so do n't take my sunshine away ... ''	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry i froze you out , lis . i -- i just did n't want the guys to think i 'd gone soft on the girl issue .	Bart Simpson
ech , i 'm tired of being an issue , bart . maybe everyone would be better off if i just quit .	Lisa Simpson
but if you quit , it 'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot !	Bart Simpson
why 'd you say that ?	Lisa Simpson
i dunno . i was just looking at my shoelaces . look , the point is , you 're going to make it , lis . and i 'm going to stick by you .	Bart Simpson
do n't do that . why should we both be outcasts ?	Lisa Simpson
then i 'll just stick by you in secret . like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that ...	Bart Simpson
will you stop looking at your feet ? !	Lisa Simpson
my killing teacher says i 'm a natural .	Bart Simpson
this was n't in the brochure .	Lisa Simpson
meet me at the eliminator '' after lights out . p.s . the cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you .	Lisa Simpson
that 's it , lis . now start crawling .	Bart Simpson
oh , it 's too hard . my hand is slipping .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't do this , bart . i 'm not strong enough .	Lisa Simpson
i thought you came here looking for a challenge .	Bart Simpson
duh ! a challenge i could do .	Lisa Simpson
uh-oh .	Bart Simpson
nothin ' .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ? well , um ... what are you doing out here ?	Bart Simpson
well . okay .	Bart Simpson
then carry on .	Bart Simpson
that was close .	Bart Simpson
bees . bees .	Lisa Simpson
bees ! yaargh !	Bart Simpson
yes !	Lisa Simpson
well , at least they 're talking to me ...	Lisa Simpson
oh , if only i were in springfield , all my friends would be cheering me on . oh , god , i 'm delirious !	Lisa Simpson
yes ! you thought i could n't but i could i did ! and i could do it again let 's do it again !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , it 's over , you made it . you can put your arms down .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't , they 're stuck .	Lisa Simpson
well , bart , uh , did you make sure to return all the guns ?	Homer Simpson
sir , yes sir ! luckily , i am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat , sir !	Bart Simpson
well , he 's got more confidence !	Marge Simpson
uh , yeah . i 've always said the boy could use more confidence .	Homer Simpson
a medal ? thank you , sir !	Lisa Simpson
for satisfactory completion of the second grade .	Lisa Simpson
well , kids , we 're so proud of the way you completed military school , we thought this time we 'd take you to disneyland for real !	Homer Simpson
yay !	Lisa Simpson
hey ! !	Lisa Simpson
'evening , moe .	Homer Simpson
you got the black one .	Homer Simpson
hey everybody , i 'm peter pantsless !	Homer Simpson
shut up ! it 's my car , and i say we 're going to the lost city of gold !	Homer Simpson
goodnight , barney . do n't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow . just slide it under the door .	Homer Simpson
so you lost my car , eh ? well , that 's just grand . i ought to punch you in the nose , but i have to pick up my kids at school .	Homer Simpson
homer , i do n't want you driving around in a car you built yourself .	Marge Simpson
marge , you can stand there finding fault , or you can knit me some seat belts .	Homer Simpson
sorry , sorry .	Marge Simpson
dad , you got a letter from the city of new york !	Lisa Simpson
throw it away ! nothing good has ever come out of new york city !	Homer Simpson
`` dear motorist , your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of manhattan ... ''	Lisa Simpson
my vehicle !	Homer Simpson
`` ... if you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours , your car will be thrown into the east river at your expense . ''	Lisa Simpson
oh , i do n't want to go to new york city .	Homer Simpson
why not ?	Marge Simpson
new york is a hellhole , and you know how i feel about hellholes .	Homer Simpson
dad , you ca n't judge a place you 've never been to .	Lisa Simpson
yeah ! that 's what people do in russia !	Bart Simpson
it 's time i told you about a chapter of my life i hoped would be closed forever . i was on my way to the harrisburg coat outlet to buy an irregular coat . but it required a stopover in new york city .	Homer Simpson
all i had to do was walk a few blocks from the port authority bus terminal to my train at penn station ...	Homer Simpson
anyhow , i must have looked at somebody the wrong way ... because the next thing i knew , i was running for my life .	Homer Simpson
and that 's when the chuds came at me .	Homer Simpson
oh , homer . of course you 'll have a bad impression of new york if you only focus on the pimps and the chuds .	Marge Simpson
aw , i 'd love to see new york . we could all go with the bus company 's special supersitter fare !	Lisa Simpson
nine bucks ? ! this one 's on me .	Bart Simpson
great ! we 're all going to new york !	Marge Simpson
lousy bart ... his money ... all right , new york , i 'm coming back . but you 're not getting this !	Homer Simpson
dad , our baby pictures were in there !	Lisa Simpson
do n't you start .	Homer Simpson
wake up , everyone . we 're almost there .	Marge Simpson
that took too long ! how come we had to transfer in atlanta twice ?	Bart Simpson
i just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms .	Lisa Simpson
marge , i ca n't feel my legs !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't feel my legs !	Homer Simpson
homer ! homer , those legs belong to the man behind you .	Marge Simpson
we 're here !	Lisa Simpson
wow ! i feel like such a nobody .	Marge Simpson
it 's wall-to-wall landmarks -- the williamsburg bridge ! fourth avenue ! governor 's island !	Marge Simpson
look , it 's zz top ! you guys rock !	Bart Simpson
now remember , criminals prey on small-town folk like us . so if anyone asks , we 're sophisticated millionaires from the ozarks .	Homer Simpson
homer , you 're scaring the children .	Marge Simpson
good . i do n't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze . you wait here at the bus station while i get the car .	Homer Simpson
the bus station is just one of the sights we came to see . we 'll meet you in central park at five o'clock .	Marge Simpson
oh , all right , but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down , all the weirdos turn crazy .	Homer Simpson
i 'm on to you !	Homer Simpson
your vehicle is illegally parked at one world trade plaza . hmmm ...	Homer Simpson
ooohh ...	Homer Simpson
wow , governor 's island looks so insignificant from up here .	Marge Simpson
hey immigrants , beat it ! country 's full !	Bart Simpson
stupid city ! what the hell is this thing ?	Homer Simpson
come off ! come off ! oh , all right , you !	Homer Simpson
ow .	Homer Simpson
they expect me to sit here from nine to five ? ! that 's how many hours ? ten , eleven , denominator ... oh , where 's lisa when you need her ?	Homer Simpson
here 's a better idea -- you give me your address , and i 'll write to you .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so glad we took the subway . `` laser wart removal '' . wow , the future is here !	Marge Simpson
hey , where 's bart ?	Lisa Simpson
ladies and gentlemen , i 'm sorry to disturb your pleasant ride , but unlike yourselves , i was born without taste buds . let me demonstrate .	Bart Simpson
i 'm in over my head here . thank you for your time .	Bart Simpson
come on ! pick up the pace !	Homer Simpson
hey ! i 'm not a bum ... thanks , but i do n't need ... okay , if you insist , but ... spare change , lady ? lousy cheapskate ...	Homer Simpson
so hungry ... ca n't leave car ... huh ...	Homer Simpson
hey , uh , could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza ?	Homer Simpson
aw , shoot . all right , all right . give me one bowl .	Homer Simpson
geez ! that 's just ... awful !	Homer Simpson
mmmm . now , what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth ?	Homer Simpson
blech ! eww ! geesh ! i 'll take a crab juice .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh . uhh ... you got a men 's room in there ?	Homer Simpson
but i ca n't leave my car until the parking guy gets here . oh , why did i drink all that crab juice ?	Homer Simpson
mmmmm .	Homer Simpson

ow ! ow ! ow ! ow !	Homer Simpson

speaking of shoes , i do n't care about shoes . i 'll meet you ladies back here in half an hour .	Bart Simpson
okay , dad ...	Lisa Simpson
stay where i can see you , honey ...	Marge Simpson
excuse me , is this mad magazine ?	Bart Simpson
uh , seriously , though -- my name is bart simpson . my father has a subscription . i 'd like the grand tour , please .	Bart Simpson
it 's gon na be dark soon . i 'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car .	Homer Simpson
oh . okay .	Bart Simpson
woooooow . i will never wash these eyes again .	Bart Simpson
shut up ! shut up ! shut up !	Homer Simpson
kickin ' it ! a musical journey through the betty ford center .	Lisa Simpson
you know , when i was a girl , i always dreamed of being in a broadway audience .	Marge Simpson
when i grow up , i want to be in the betty ford center .	Bart Simpson
you better start saving now . it 's very expensive .	Marge Simpson
shhh ! they 're strapping down liza minelli .	Lisa Simpson
aha ! i 've got it ! brain , how can i ever thank you ?	Homer Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson

thanks for your patience !	Homer Simpson
what a perfect way to end our day in new york .	Lisa Simpson
i hope your father had as much fun as we did .	Marge Simpson
ow !	Homer Simpson
hey , it 's dad ! right on time !	Bart Simpson
we 're getting outta here , now ! jump in , marge ! trust me ! throw the kids ! no time for the baby !	Homer Simpson
we 're not jumping , homer .	Marge Simpson
come on ! let 's go ! everyone into the car ! now !	Homer Simpson
what a magical city ! can we come back next year , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
we 'll see , honey .	Homer Simpson
we 'll see .	Homer Simpson
ralph and i could do the report together .	Lisa Simpson
bart ? why are you doing that ?	Marge Simpson
our class is making refreshments for skinner 's party . these are in honor of his army days .	Bart Simpson
uh huh , that explains the flags . what about the dog food ?	Marge Simpson
my theory is , skinner likes dog food .	Bart Simpson
let 's bake him a cake .	Marge Simpson
ooh , a fresh batch of america balls ! mmm ...	Homer Simpson
... so in 1966 , a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and shipped out to vietnam , where he rose to become platoon sergeant . ralph ?	Lisa Simpson
sgt . skinner was a hero . he risked capture many times behind enemy lines .	Lisa Simpson
and he survived to make it back to springfield , where he became the fine educator we salute tonight .	Lisa Simpson
i hope you all brought forks and plates !	Bart Simpson
that 's not a funny story .	Marge Simpson
principal skinner ?	Bart Simpson
come on ! get to the part where you steal his identity !	Bart Simpson
oh , it 's one of those stories .	Bart Simpson
look , lady , you obviously have at least one son .	Homer Simpson
hey , armin .	Bart Simpson
mrs. krabappel sent me . i forged my dad 's signature on my report card .	Bart Simpson
well , i do n't see how me signing homer 's name is any different from you using sgt . skinner 's name .	Bart Simpson
hey , hey , hey ! easy there , you big impostor .	Bart Simpson
not to us you 're not . i mean , how would you feel if you suddenly found out ned flanders was an impostor ?	Marge Simpson
my next-door neighbor ? religious guy ?	Marge Simpson
no i do n't ! what i mean is , to me you 're just a stranger pretending to be something he 's not .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , but that 's just how i feel .	Marge Simpson
i admit sgt . skinner seems okay ... but mr. tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration .	Lisa Simpson
he lied about his name .	Bart Simpson
his name does n't matter . `` a rose by any other name would smell as sweet . ''	Lisa Simpson
not if you called 'em `` stench blossoms '' .	Bart Simpson
or `` crapweeds '' .	Homer Simpson
i 'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine 's day . i 'd rather have candy .	Marge Simpson
not if they were called `` scumdrops '' .	Homer Simpson
hey america , you 're so fine . you 're so fine , you blow my mind . america .	Bart Simpson
fair enough .	Homer Simpson
good morning , agnes . how 's your new son working out ?	Marge Simpson
and have ten items or less .	Marge Simpson
oh , now be fair , edna . i liked armin tamzarian too , but he was at least as big a weenie as sgt . skinner .	Marge Simpson
did you ever tell him that ?	Marge Simpson
okay , once more . where are we going ?	Homer Simpson
and why are you and the old lady in the car ?	Homer Simpson
and why is marge here ?	Homer Simpson
i came up with the idea .	Marge Simpson
and why am i here ?	Homer Simpson
because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies .	Marge Simpson
and why are the kids here ?	Homer Simpson
because we could n't find grampa to sit for them .	Marge Simpson
and why is grampa here ?	Homer Simpson
can i see your copy of `` swank '' , armin ?	Homer Simpson
hey , everybody , look ! armin tamzarian 's back and he 's gon na take over the school again !	Homer Simpson
all right , all right . so , he 's a fraud . i do n't care ! his mom does n't care ! do any of you care ?	Homer Simpson
now , if you 'll allow me , i think i have a solution that 'll satisfy the town and let sgt . skinner keep his dignity .	Homer Simpson
and we salute you for it . now do n't come back .	Homer Simpson
oh no we do n't ! judge snyder ?	Homer Simpson
boy the way the bee gees played ...	Homer Simpson
movies john travolta made ...	Marge Simpson
guessing how much elvis weighed ...	Homer Simpson
those were the days .	Marge Simpson
and you knew where you were then ...	Marge Simpson
watching shows like gentle ben ...	Homer Simpson
mister , we could use a man like sheriff lobo again .	Homer Simpson
disco duck and fleetwood mac ...	Homer Simpson
coming out of my eight-track ...	Marge Simpson
michael jackson still was black ...	Marge Simpson
those were the days .	Marge Simpson
hey there , meathead . what are you watchin ' ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i thought i 'd check out the warner brothers network .	Bart Simpson
all right ! they 're gon na show his disastrous marriage to mia farrow !	Bart Simpson
what a bad father .	Homer Simpson
lisa , knock off that racket !	Homer Simpson
but dad , i 'm supposed to practice an hour a day !	Lisa Simpson
i 'll practice you !	Homer Simpson
you 'll practice me ? what does that mean ? is it supposed to be some sort of threat ?	Lisa Simpson
bart , make her stop .	Homer Simpson
look , bart . i have to practice my saxophone and you ca n't stop me .	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah ? my dear lisa , you are eight and i am ten . and in my two extra years on this planet , i 've learned a few tricks . gim me that sax !	Bart Simpson
no !	Lisa Simpson
i said gim me !	Bart Simpson
i said no !	Lisa Simpson
aw , lisa , it does n't look so bad .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , honey , if it 'll make you feel better i 'll destroy something bart loves .	Homer Simpson
hey !	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , son . if that bothers you , i 'll destroy something maggie loves .	Homer Simpson
dad , you do n't understand . this saxophone is like my oldest friend . i 've had it for as long as i can remember .	Lisa Simpson
you do n't remember how you got it ?	Homer Simpson
nuh-uh .	Lisa Simpson
oh , well , it all happened in 1990. back then , the artist formerly known as prince was currently known as prince . tracey ullman was entertaining america with songs , sketches , and crudely-drawn filler material . and bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school ...	Homer Simpson
look , mama !	Lisa Simpson
oh , honey , i ca n't right now . bart 's gon na be late !	Marge Simpson
now , son , on your first day of school , i 'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me ...	Homer Simpson
lousy traumatic childhood .	Homer Simpson
ooh , there 's the bus . goodbye , sweetheart !	Marge Simpson

watch the fish , marge .	Homer Simpson
what did i tell you , marge ?	Homer Simpson

oh , let 's get that .	Homer Simpson
would n't we all suffocate ?	Marge Simpson
let 's get that ! the suffocation thing !	Homer Simpson
five hundred dollars ! forget it .	Homer Simpson
i would n't have thought so either , but here we are .	Homer Simpson
homer , we need something to protect this family .	Marge Simpson
i could n't agree more , marjorie . you deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have .	Homer Simpson
i do n't have to be careful , i got a gun .	Homer Simpson
oh , yeah .	Homer Simpson
baby .	Homer Simpson
mmm-hmm .	Homer Simpson
ahh .	Homer Simpson
ooo , i like the sound of that .	Homer Simpson
oh , i do n't need anything like that - yet . just gim me my gun .	Homer Simpson
five days ! but i 'm mad now !	Homer Simpson
i 'd kill you if i had my gun .	Homer Simpson
lousy big shot . thinks he 's so big 'cause he 's got a lot of guns .	Homer Simpson
well , if he did n't have any guns , i 'd show him a thing or two .	Homer Simpson
let 's see what happens when he walks into my store . then we 'll see who 's worried about five day waiting period ...	Homer Simpson
dad ! it 's three a.m. ! ca n't you mutter in your room ?	Lisa Simpson
marge kicked me out .	Homer Simpson
all right . go ahead .	Lisa Simpson
pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house . i tell you parents these days , they do n't know how to rear children .	Homer Simpson
how am i supposed to last five days without shooting something ?	Homer Simpson
come on , come on , open up !	Homer Simpson
now , i believe you have some sort of firearm for me .	Homer Simpson
yuh .	Homer Simpson
yeah .	Homer Simpson
former president .	Homer Simpson
potentially dangerous ?	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
close your eyes marge , i 've got a surprise for you .	Homer Simpson
okay . open your eyes !	Homer Simpson
hey , it 's a handgun ! is n't it great ? this is the trigger ... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die ...	Homer Simpson
homer , i do n't want guns in my house ! do n't you remember when maggie shot mr. burns ?	Marge Simpson
i thought smithers did it .	Homer Simpson
that would have made a lot more sense .	Lisa Simpson
hey dad , can i borrow the gun tomorrow ? i want to scare that old security guard at the bank .	Bart Simpson
only if you clean your room .	Homer Simpson
no ! no one 's using this gun . the tv said , you 're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder .	Marge Simpson
tv said that ? but i have to have a gun . it 's in the constitution .	Homer Simpson
dad ! the 2nd amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days . it has no meaning today .	Lisa Simpson
you could n't be more wrong , lisa . if i did n't have this gun , the king of england could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around . do you want that ? huh ? do you ?	Homer Simpson
no ...	Lisa Simpson
all right , then .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , homer . no weapons .	Marge Simpson
a gun is not a weapon , marge . it 's a tool . like a butcher knife or a harpoon or ... a ... a ... an alligator . you just need more education on the subject . tell you what : you come with me to an nra meeting , and if you still do n't think guns are great , we 'll argue some more .	Homer Simpson
no , thanks !	Lisa Simpson
pull !	Homer Simpson
learnin ' somethin ' , marge ?	Homer Simpson
hi , i 'm homer s .	Homer Simpson
hi . it seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar , it 's good enough to protect my family . so if you 'll have me , i would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization !	Homer Simpson
homer , you ca n't join up with these gun nuts .	Marge Simpson
oh , come on , be fair marge . for once in your life , be fair .	Homer Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson
what ? oh apu , i would never ...	Homer Simpson
or would i ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll do it ! i 'll rob the kwik-e-mart .	Homer Simpson
all right , put your ... oh well , i 'll rob it next time .	Homer Simpson
can you help me get my ball down from the roof , dad ?	Lisa Simpson

see you in hell , dinner plate .	Homer Simpson
does anyone know where all my dinner plates went ?	Marge Simpson
uhmm ...	Bart Simpson
mmm , you probably left them at work . on another topic , guess who was picked to host the next nra get-together ?	Homer Simpson
homer , i told you this morning , no guns at the dinner table .	Marge Simpson
you said the breakfast table .	Homer Simpson
it 's the same table !	Marge Simpson
listen , if it 'll make you feel any better , i 'll put the safety on .	Homer Simpson
oops , guess it already was on .	Homer Simpson
uh . i 'd better just put it down .	Homer Simpson
no offense , mom , but that was pretty cool .	Lisa Simpson
homer , i think you 'd agree that i 've put up with a lot in this marriage .	Marge Simpson
but this is the first time since we 've been married that i 've actually feared for our lives . so i 'm asking you , if you really care about me and the children , please , please get rid of the gun .	Marge Simpson
all right , marge . i 'll do it . for you .	Homer Simpson
i 'm a lucky woman .	Marge Simpson
and i 'm a wonderful man .	Homer Simpson
i do n't feel them .	Bart Simpson
first , it 's fudge-cicle ... and i know they 're up there . i just need a better foothold .	Bart Simpson
hello .	Bart Simpson
and the next marksman is ... william tell , jr. !	Bart Simpson
bart !	Marge Simpson
oh , i see bart gets to have a gun .	Homer Simpson
you lied to me ! you promised to get rid of this gun !	Marge Simpson
i put it in a safe place , marge . i mean , what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper ?	Homer Simpson
how could you ? ! of all the terrible things you 've ever done in your life , this is the worst ... the most despicable ...	Marge Simpson
but marge , i swear to you , i never thought you 'd find out !	Homer Simpson
until you decide what 's more important - your gun or your family - we ca n't live in the same house . come on , kids .	Marge Simpson
so this is the thanks i get for protecting my family ? then go ! i 'll be just fine !	Homer Simpson
i 've left homer .	Marge Simpson
so we need a place to spend the night .	Marge Simpson
why ca n't we stay here ?	Marge Simpson
ooo , the gun club 's gon na be here any minute !	Homer Simpson

oh , honey , please come home . i need you . it 's dark in the house and i 'm hungry and lonesome . and there 's no one there to hear my various witty remarks .	Homer Simpson
what about the gun ?	Marge Simpson
it 's gone for good , marge . i finally realized , what 's the point of having a gun for protection if you 've got no one to protect ?	Homer Simpson

okay , do n't shoot !	Homer Simpson
how did you know we were being robbed ?	Marge Simpson
did anyone stop that robber ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry i lied to you , marge . but this gun had a hold on me . i felt this incredible surge of power , like god must feel when he 's holding a gun . so please , get rid of it , because i know i 'll just lie to you again and again !	Homer Simpson
now wait a second . you doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day !	Homer Simpson
now make no mistake . when i say `` first aid , '' i 'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert !	Marge Simpson
i 'm talking about treating serious injuries .	Marge Simpson

it looks like a human skeleton ... but these other bones look almost like wings .	Lisa Simpson
well , obviously that 's impossible --	Lisa Simpson
now that 's interesting .	Homer Simpson
but it ca n't be an angel !	Lisa Simpson
well , maybe it 's , uh , uh ... a neanderthal , who got bitten by some angry fish .	Lisa Simpson
it could be anything . it could be a mutant from the nuclear plant .	Lisa Simpson

dad , it 's not fair to claim this thing is an angel . there 's no proof of that .	Lisa Simpson
no one 's calling it an angel , lisa . if you 'll look carefully , you 'll notice i never once used the word `` angel '' .	Homer Simpson
what about that sign right there ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's a typo .	Homer Simpson
just let me take it to the museum for one day . they can do scientific tests and prove it 's not an angel .	Lisa Simpson
oh , no . oh , no . we could lose out on bags and bags of money . it 's sacrilegious , i tell ya .	Homer Simpson
wow ... so lifelike .	Lisa Simpson
it 's a bone scraping from that skeleton i found .	Lisa Simpson
quite preposterous . but no one will believe me until i can prove what it really is . ca n't you do a dna test or something ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , thank you so much ! uhm ... you know i ca n't afford to pay you .	Lisa Simpson
excuse me . i took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis . soon we will have all the facts .	Lisa Simpson
pfft ! facts are meaningless . you can use facts to prove anything that 's even remotely true . facts shmacts .	Homer Simpson
inconclusive ? then why did you come running up like that ?	Lisa Simpson
but --	Lisa Simpson
i am home .	Lisa Simpson
okay , folks . get your angel glow sticks ! no one gets into heaven without a glow stick !	Homer Simpson
ugh , those morons make me so angry .	Lisa Simpson

but they are morons . what grown person could believe in angels ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... your mother , for one .	Marge Simpson
you ? but ... you 're an intelligent person , mom .	Lisa Simpson
there has to be more to life than just what we see , lisa . everyone needs something to believe in .	Marge Simpson
it 's not that i do n't have a spiritual side . i just find it hard to believe there 's a dead angel hanging in our garage .	Lisa Simpson
my poor lisa . if you ca n't make a leap of faith now and then , well ... i feel sorry for you .	Marge Simpson
do n't feel sorry for me , mom . i feel sorry for you .	Lisa Simpson
kent .	Lisa Simpson
i just think it 's a fantasy . if you believe in angels , then why not unicorns , or sea monsters , or leprechauns ?	Lisa Simpson
look , you can either accept science and face reality , or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world .	Lisa Simpson
we should have lived together first .	Bart Simpson
ugh , i wish i 'd never found those stupid bones ! it 's time to put an end to this . bart , i 'm borrowing your blue crowbar .	Lisa Simpson
good ol ' bluey .	Bart Simpson

hardly . anyone could have written that .	Lisa Simpson
oh angel , listen not to this child of satan .	Homer Simpson
why are we getting dressed up , mom ? are we going to black angus ?	Bart Simpson
so we 're not going to black angus .	Bart Simpson
will you leave me alone ? it 's bad enough you 're making me go to your stupid `` judgment day '' .	Lisa Simpson
please , lisa . i do n't know exactly what 's gon na happen , but i really wish we could make peace before sunset .	Marge Simpson
nothing is going to happen , mom . i hate to disappoint you , but the world is not coming to an end .	Lisa Simpson
oh , marge , do n't let go , no matter what . if they want you in heaven , they got ta take me , too .	Homer Simpson
well , there you go . i hope you all learned a val --	Lisa Simpson
wait a second ! you planted a phony skeleton for me to find ! this was all a big hoax .	Lisa Simpson
you exploited people 's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares ? ! well , we are outraged ! are n't we ? !	Lisa Simpson
i do n't understand , professor . why did n't your tests show the skeleton was a fake ?	Lisa Simpson
well , i guess you were right , honey . but you have to admit , when that angel started to talk , you were squeezing my hand pretty hard .	Marge Simpson
well , it was just so loud and ... heh , heh , heh ... thanks for sqeezing back .	Lisa Simpson

that 's dilapidated .	Marge Simpson
that house is on fire .	Marge Simpson
that 's a beauty .	Marge Simpson
ooo , i remember . mrs. astor was very lucky .	Marge Simpson
lousy doormat .	Homer Simpson
i thought i 'd do anything to succeed in business . but bending the truth ... i do n't know .	Marge Simpson
ah , so you do n't have that killer instinct . big deal .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , honey . even if you do n't succeed in the business world , you 're still the world 's greatest wife and mother .	Homer Simpson

um-hmmm .	Lisa Simpson
well , i can too compete . and i 'm going to sell a house . end of story .	Marge Simpson
kids , your mother 's under a lot of pressure . why do n't we let her clear the table in peace ?	Homer Simpson
the first house i have to show you is , uhm , a handyman 's dream .	Marge Simpson
because it 's so dilapidated .	Marge Simpson

well , that about does it for houses in this area ...	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , mr. hutz , but i just ca n't lie to people .	Marge Simpson
no . there is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house .	Marge Simpson
no , no . no tricks . it was salesmanship , that 's all .	Marge Simpson
but it was !	Marge Simpson

ooo , gumball .	Homer Simpson
wow , honey , you sold a house and got rid of the flanders . what 's for dinner ?	Homer Simpson

you know me , marge . i crave the hustle and bustle .	Homer Simpson
homer ! look at this mob ! the good toys are probably all gone .	Marge Simpson
oh , santa 's got a little trick up his sleeve .	Homer Simpson
attention , shoppers . register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience .	Homer Simpson

for once we 're gon na celebrate christmas as a family .	Marge Simpson
ah , 12 glasses of water . that 'll wake me up nice and early , and i 'll have a big head-start on opening presents . pure genius .	Bart Simpson
you did n't invent that , bart . the indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks .	Lisa Simpson

dear santa . if you bring me lotsa good stuff , i promise not to do anything bad between now and when i wake up . amen .	Bart Simpson

well , there 's no easy way to say it , kids : god hates us .	Homer Simpson
hey , since when is christmas just about the presents ? are n't we forgetting the true meaning of this day ? the birth of santa ?	Bart Simpson
bart 's absolutely right . this is the one day that should n't be about material things .	Marge Simpson
hey , why do n't we walk over to grampa 's and cheer up the old folks ? that 'll make us feel better .	Lisa Simpson
okay , but they 'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy .	Homer Simpson
looks like the flanders are having a nice christmas .	Marge Simpson
oh yeah ? we 'll show 'em . come on , kids , pretend we 've got new cross-country skis .	Homer Simpson
that 's not as fun as it looks .	Homer Simpson
nothing could be as fun as that looks .	Lisa Simpson

marge , kids , let 's go buy some happiness !	Homer Simpson
is this car $ 15,000 ?	Homer Simpson
what a deal ! i 'd be a sucker not to get it .	Homer Simpson

i knew this would happen .	Homer Simpson
well , at least the burglar 's having a merry christmas .	Marge Simpson
bart ! you 're up early .	Marge Simpson
i could n't sleep .	Bart Simpson
what 's wrong ?	Marge Simpson
there was no burglar .	Bart Simpson
no burglar ? / what ? / what 's he mean ?	Lisa Simpson
i accidentally burned up the tree and the presents . i 'm really sorry .	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Lisa Simpson
lisa , no ! your hands are too weak !	Homer Simpson
stop that !	Marge Simpson
i 'm gon na kill you ! / no , i 'm killing him first ! / why you little ... bart , the next time you ever have ... / you went too far ...	Homer Simpson
yes , kent . `` hello , jerk . we may never find you , and we should probably all stop looking . but one thing 's for sure : you do exist . ''	Homer Simpson
also , we want to thank the whole town for their generosity .	Marge Simpson
oh , it 's true ! we were n't robbed ! that part we made up ! but the rest is true !	Homer Simpson
wait ! he 's just covering for me ! i destroyed the presents , then i buried the evidence . and i acted alone .	Bart Simpson
well , the boy told us . but that was after we filed a phony police report .	Homer Simpson
and after we spent all the townspeople 's money .	Lisa Simpson
so you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago .	Marge Simpson
i think they 're running out of tomatoes .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , but they 've still got plenty of pumpkins .	Bart Simpson
oh , homer . i 'm so ashamed .	Marge Simpson
relax , marge . this 'll all blow over .	Homer Simpson
oh , no . look at the line !	Homer Simpson
head of the line ! a family could get used to being shunned . huh ? huh ?	Homer Simpson
um , miss hoover ! miss hoover !	Lisa Simpson
run for your lives , everyone ! this is not a drill !	Homer Simpson
`` ... you 'll all get yours in hell , you lying , thieving , blanking blankers . sincerely , moe . ''	Marge Simpson
oh great , now we have to send him a card .	Homer Simpson
i know you 're used to getting hate mail , but i 'm not .	Marge Simpson
there 's only one way out . we 've got ta give this greedy town its money back .	Homer Simpson
but we do n't have $ 15,000 .	Lisa Simpson
unless ...	Marge Simpson
but mr. trebek --	Marge Simpson
run , mom !	Lisa Simpson
i guess we better get used to being pariahs .	Lisa Simpson
there 's no shame in being a pariah .	Marge Simpson
oh no , there 's that angry mob again .	Homer Simpson
they 've forgiven us . it 's a miracle ! you know , deep down , people are pretty g -- hey , wait a minute ! they 're taking our stuff !	Marge Simpson
good lord !	Marge Simpson
what the hell 's goin ' on ?	Homer Simpson
look , i know this has been a stressful holiday . but , in a way , having nothing reminds us how lucky we really are .	Marge Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
we still have each other . and is n't that the best gift of all ?	Marge Simpson
but we would have had each other anyway .	Lisa Simpson
yeah . plus lots of other stuff .	Bart Simpson
maybe so . but there 's one thing they forgot to take away from us . this washcloth .	Homer Simpson
hey , that 's my washcloth .	Bart Simpson
the hell it is !	Homer Simpson
gim me that ! / uh , gim me that ! / no ! / let go ! / gim me that my washcloth ! / i want it !	Homer Simpson
stop this madness . it 's just a washcloth .	Marge Simpson
besides , it 's mine . yoink !	Marge Simpson
hey , she 's getting away with the washcloth !	Homer Simpson
hey !	Lisa Simpson
head her off at the stairs !	Bart Simpson
i 'm over here !	Marge Simpson
she 's going around the other side . now get her !	Bart Simpson

oh , i got it ! oh , it 's just a thread ! it was ... she 's got ... she 's got the washcloth !	Homer Simpson
we got the popcorn ! did you get `` waiting to exhale ? ''	Marge Simpson
well , they put us on the `` waiting to exhale waiting list . '' but they said do n't hold your breath .	Homer Simpson
did you get `` emma ? '' did you get `` emma ? '' did ya ? did ya ? did ya ? huh ?	Lisa Simpson
whoa . whoa . calm down , little lady -- take it easy -- take it easy . no .	Homer Simpson
what did you get ?	Marge Simpson
something very close , exactly along those lines -- a clint eastwood - lee marvin shoot 'em up western !	Homer Simpson
so prepare yourself , for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan 's , `` paint your wagon ! ''	Bart Simpson
with blood , i bet !	Homer Simpson
they 're singing ! they 're singing , marge ! why are n't they killing each other ?	Homer Simpson
yeah , their guns are right there !	Bart Simpson
wait , wait , wait . here comes lee marvin . thank god . he 's always drunk and violent .	Homer Simpson
mm ! who knew that lee marvin could do such marvelous splits ?	Marge Simpson
he 's dreamy .	Lisa Simpson
bart !	Homer Simpson
ooh , why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing ?	Homer Simpson
i thought it was toe-tappin ' fun .	Marge Simpson
singing is the lowest form of communication .	Homer Simpson
homer , you sing all the time !	Marge Simpson
no i do n't , i hate to rhyme .	Homer Simpson
you like musicals , do n't you dad ?	Lisa Simpson
no i do n't , i think they 're bad / they 're fake and phoney and totally wrong .	Homer Simpson
wake up dad / you 're singing a song !	Bart Simpson
i would n't / i could n't / i hate that stuff !	Homer Simpson
now homer , listen , i 've had enough ! / in our family videos , we have plainly seen / you 're a singing , dancing , entertainment machine !	Marge Simpson
mom was right , your singing 's a sin / you 're as les miserables / as lee mar-vin !	Bart Simpson
sure your dad 's singing / could make your hair curl / but you too bart / have sung and danced like a girl .	Marge Simpson
eep .	Bart Simpson
that was pretty bad , bart / but it could 've been worse / you could have been carrying a sequined purse !	Lisa Simpson
i hate to dance and prance and sing / that 's really more of a millhouse thing !	Bart Simpson
i think you move like a young baryshnikov !	Marge Simpson
oooooo .	Lisa Simpson
it 's a desperate criminal / on the run from the law / please spare my children !	Marge Simpson
and their damp-trousered pa .	Homer Simpson
see ? all this singing scared him away / if we just talked like normal , he 'd probably stay .	Homer Simpson
many people in this town / sing like we do / there 's mister burns , there 's krusty , and even apu .	Lisa Simpson
because he was singing , we overheard his plan / and could save those dogs from that mean old man .	Lisa Simpson
it still was n't worth burns ' song and dance .	Bart Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
i knew i should 've shut that window .	Homer Simpson
even the criminals are beginning to croon .	Homer Simpson
homie , this whole town runs on a tune ! / our churches , our clubs our government too .	Marge Simpson
springfield swings like a pendulum do !	Bart Simpson
we ca n't even get any local laws passed / without everyone singing like a big broadway cast .	Lisa Simpson
all right marge , you 've convinced me , there are more terrible things / than musical comedies where everyone sings .	Homer Simpson
there is something worse ...	Lisa Simpson
and it really does blow ...	Bart Simpson
actually , we 're done .	Marge Simpson
done , done .	Bart Simpson
and not a moment too soon .	Homer Simpson
okay , who wants dinner ?	Marge Simpson
well , let 's get eatin ' .	Marge Simpson

the experts say that if you want an animal to do something , you should do it yourself first to show him how .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard .	Marge Simpson
sor-reee , your majesty .	Homer Simpson

but i ca n't go out dressed like this ! what if someone sees me ?	Bart Simpson
you 're just going into our backyard . no one will see you .	Marge Simpson

but it does n't look safe . and the guy running it looks a little seedy . no offense .	Marge Simpson
he 's not just some `` guy , '' marge . he 's a carny , and part of a noble tradition . carnies built this country . the carnival part of it , anyway . and though they may be rat-like in appearance , they are truly kings among men .	Homer Simpson

they want cheap sentiment ? i 'll pump 'em so full of sap they 'll be blowing their nose with a pancake .	Lisa Simpson

our forgotten veterans . their guns are quiet now . their helmets lost , or pawned . and yet here they are , making flags out of old clothes . sure , they may not have the right number of stripes , and the colors are all wrong , and some purists will tell you the american flag does n't contain the word , `` jordache . '' but you know , if they run this up the flagpole , i 'll salute . i 'm bart simpson .	Bart Simpson
hmm , thank you , bart , for yet another touching `` bart 's people . '' now , turning to --	Lisa Simpson

i know , honey . but this is a very unusual situation ... at least it would be for most families .	Marge Simpson
what if i took a bus ?	Lisa Simpson
a bus ? alone ? absolutely not . it 's just too dangerous for an eight-year- old . in a few years , when you 're old enough to drive , then you can take a bus .	Marge Simpson
but it 's the last day of the isis exhibit !	Lisa Simpson
well , you should have thought of that before i glued all this stuff to my face .	Bart Simpson
hello ?	Homer Simpson
dad ?	Lisa Simpson
who is this ?	Homer Simpson
it 's lisa . i just called to tell you how much i love you and can i take the bus to the museum ?	Lisa Simpson
museum ? i do n't like the sound of that . what did your mother say ?	Homer Simpson
ahm ... i was n't a hundred per cent clear on that . she said something , but she was kind of in a rush to get bart to the emergency room .	Lisa Simpson
hmm . so you want to take the bus , huh ? i do n't know . that 's a pretty big decision ...	Homer Simpson
well ... if it would put your mind at ease , i could take a limousine . although that would cost two hundred dollars ...	Lisa Simpson
two hundred dollars ? ! is n't there any other way ?	Homer Simpson
hmm . i guess i could take the bus , if you think that 's a better idea .	Lisa Simpson
frankly , i do . i know you had your heart set on a limo , but sometimes daddies have to say no , honey . i 'm afraid you 're gon na have to take the bus .	Homer Simpson
oh , all right .	Lisa Simpson
atta girl . i love you , sweet --	Homer Simpson
yes !	Lisa Simpson
ah , the old number 22. clean , reliable public transportation . the chariot of the people . the ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike . sure , some folks prefer --	Lisa Simpson

but i 'm lost and i need to know where --	Lisa Simpson
i should 've got off in crackton .	Lisa Simpson
okay , the museum 's got to be north of here . now which way is north ... ?	Lisa Simpson
aha ! it 's springtime , so the geese must be flying back north .	Lisa Simpson
hey !	Lisa Simpson
see , bart ? there 's another boy who played with glue .	Marge Simpson
that 's the kind of faucet i want for your bathroom .	Marge Simpson
how could i confuse bus 22 with bus 22a ?	Lisa Simpson
area 51 ? i found area 51 !	Lisa Simpson
well , um , i 'm kind of lost . can you tell me where i am ?	Lisa Simpson
stupid bus that ca n't even go to the stupid place it 's supposed to stupid go .	Lisa Simpson
yahhh !	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh . um , listen , i 'm kind of lost . do you think you could give me a lift downtown ?	Lisa Simpson
can you help him , doctor ?	Marge Simpson
what happened ? you did n't do anything .	Marge Simpson
could n't you have just turned up the heat a little ?	Bart Simpson
homer , what 's going on ? should n't you be at work ?	Marge Simpson
my daughter 's at that egyptian dealy right now . she wanted to take a limo , but i made her take the bus .	Homer Simpson
mmmaybe ... but you do n't know lisa . i mean she 's so smart , they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things , but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire .	Homer Simpson
uh , yesss ... but now i have to leave on a totally unrelated matter .	Homer Simpson
lisa !	Homer Simpson
i did n't know springfield had a russian district .	Lisa Simpson
excuse me . can you tell me how to get to the museum ?	Lisa Simpson

oh , that 's it . i give up .	Lisa Simpson

dad , grab onto it !	Lisa Simpson
oh , lisa , thank god you 're okay !	Homer Simpson
ow ! ow ! ow ! oww !	Homer Simpson

nah , i 'll just walk it off .	Homer Simpson
i should have known i was n't old enough to take the bus alone , but i really wanted to see that exhibit . i 'll never take another stupid risk like that again !	Lisa Simpson
do n't ever say that .	Homer Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
if i hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker , i never would have found you .	Homer Simpson
i guess ...	Lisa Simpson
stupid risks are what make life worth living . now your mother , she 's the steady type , and that 's fine in small doses . but me , i 'm a risk taker . and that 's why i have so many adventures .	Homer Simpson
dad ! you 're headed for the river again !	Lisa Simpson
feel your heart pumping a mile a minute ? that 's what my heart 's doing all the time . bet your left arm 's tingling too , huh ?	Homer Simpson
dad , are you all right ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm enjoying my life too much to care . and you should be too . so what would you like to do right now , more than anything in the world ? !	Homer Simpson
see the isis exhibit . but the museum 's closed .	Lisa Simpson
closed , eh ? so getting in would be a pretty big risk . what do you say , honey ? feeling stupid ? i know i am .	Homer Simpson
lisa , we 're home ! sorry about the museum ! you 'd better go up and apologize .	Marge Simpson
but my apologies always sound so forced .	Bart Simpson
do it !	Marge Simpson
hey , lis . i 'm sorry i ruined your egyptian thing . we 're still buds , right ?	Bart Simpson
okay , be that way . be a big , stupid jerk .	Bart Simpson
oh , you 're not the jerk , i am . forgive me ? oh , like you 're miss perfect ! mom ! lisa 's making me feel bad !	Bart Simpson

dad , that 's the old spice song .	Lisa Simpson

if she did n't want her car ruined , she should 've done a better job hiding her keys .	Homer Simpson

oh , i ca n't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business . i 've been muscled out of everything i 've ever done , including my muscle-for-hire business .	Homer Simpson
my poor homie . could n't you try some other far-out money-making scheme ?	Marge Simpson

all right , son , we 're about to embark on our most difficult mission . let 's bow our heads in prayer .	Homer Simpson
dear lord , i know you 're busy , seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that . but if you help us steal this grease tonight , i promise we 'll donate half the profits to charity .	Homer Simpson
dad , he 's not stupid .	Bart Simpson
all right , screw it . let 's roll .	Homer Simpson
mmm ... i knew i should have attached those somehow .	Homer Simpson
lucky parameciums .	Lisa Simpson
you do n't have to worry about finding dates or dancing .	Lisa Simpson

thanks , mom . but i told you , i 'm not going .	Lisa Simpson
ohh , so you do n't have a date . you can still go and have a wonderful time .	Marge Simpson
you do n't understand . i do n't belong there . the other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating . they make me feel like a little baby .	Lisa Simpson
oh , honey . a baby could n't have organized a big school dance . unless it was especially skilled . or one of those super-babies from brazil .	Marge Simpson
forget it , mom . i 'm not going .	Lisa Simpson
but they 're counting on you to take tickets . and if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow , why , you could be the belle of the ball .	Marge Simpson
mom , you ca n't possibly believe that .	Lisa Simpson
i have to , honey . or ... you can stay here and we 'll have our own dance . `` every simpson dance now ! bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp ! ''	Marge Simpson
i 'll go .	Lisa Simpson
this better work , boy . i do n't wan na wind up workin ' on your mother 's emu farm .	Homer Simpson

huh ?	Lisa Simpson
what happened ?	Lisa Simpson
kids ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's because they are kids . and so are we . c'mon , alex , we 've only got nine , maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church , and chew with our mouths open , and go days without bathing . we 'll never have that freedom again .	Lisa Simpson
uh ... guys ? guys ? the hose .	Bart Simpson
bart , please . the groundskeeper and i are trying to settle this like adults .	Homer Simpson
that 's my grease ! it 's mine ! give it here !	Homer Simpson
oh , act your age .	Lisa Simpson
website .	Homer Simpson
seventy-six point two ? ! but i 'm already thirty-eight point one ! i 've wasted half my life !	Homer Simpson
half my life gone ! and i 'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years .	Homer Simpson
marge ! i 've wasted half my life .	Homer Simpson
what are you talking about , marge ? i do n't need a ...	Homer Simpson
okay , send the truck .	Homer Simpson
oh , honey , do n't eat that . would n't you rather have your sugar bag ?	Marge Simpson
no , i do n't deserve sugar . i 'm halfway to my grave , and i have n't accomplished anything . oh , i am not looking forward to my funeral .	Homer Simpson
marge , no matter what happens in the future , promise me you wo n't vote for lenny .	Homer Simpson
okay , but you 've accomplished a lot . you 've made me very happy .	Marge Simpson
oh yeah , they 'll put me on a stamp for that .	Homer Simpson
i 've wasted half my life , marge . do you know how many memories i have ? three ! standing in line for a movie , having a key made , and sitting here talking to you . thirty-eight years and that 's all i have to show for it .	Homer Simpson
you 're thirty-nine .	Marge Simpson
hi , dad . how was work ?	Lisa Simpson
cold .	Homer Simpson
come on , let 's get you into your favorite shirt .	Lisa Simpson
surprise !	Lisa Simpson
oh . i see you 're having a party . i 'll come back later .	Homer Simpson
you ca n't come back later because ...	Bart Simpson
homer simpson , welcome to your life !	Lisa Simpson
the kids and i want to show you all the great things you 've done .	Marge Simpson
oh , all right . maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong .	Homer Simpson
quiet , dad , or we 'll have to throw you outta here .	Bart Simpson
there you are in outer space . that 's pretty impressive .	Lisa Simpson
all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir .	Homer Simpson
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ ?	Bart Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
well , there 's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children .	Marge Simpson
hike .	Homer Simpson
oh , i shoulda punted . turn it off ! turn it off !	Homer Simpson
hang on , dad , this next part 'll definitely make you feel better about yourself .	Bart Simpson
stupid movies . who invented these dumb things anyway ? was it you , bart ?	Homer Simpson
it was thomas edison , dad .	Lisa Simpson
i thought he invented the light bulb .	Bart Simpson
that , too . he also invented the phonograph , the microphone , and the electric car .	Lisa Simpson
no one man can do all that . you 're a liar , honey . a dirty , rotten liar .	Homer Simpson
it 's true . i read it on a place mat at a restaurant .	Lisa Simpson
really ? a restaurant ? well , now i do n't know what to think .	Homer Simpson
top of the world , ma !	Bart Simpson
cut it out , boy !	Homer Simpson
dad ? what are you doin ' here ?	Bart Simpson
reading about this edison character . they wo n't let me in the big people library downtown . there was some unpleasantness . i can never go back .	Homer Simpson
ooh , look at all the inventions edison came up with . the stock ticker , the storage battery , even wax paper . and look at him dance .	Homer Simpson
de de de de de .	Homer Simpson
that 's great , dad .	Bart Simpson
and these hardy boys books are great , too . this one is about smugglers .	Homer Simpson
they 're all about smugglers .	Bart Simpson
no , not this one . `` the smugglers of pirate cove . '' it 's about pirates .	Homer Simpson
i think it 's pretty obvious that i am .	Homer Simpson
go school !	Homer Simpson
that does n't sound like me . well , i suppose if this does n't work out you can always go back to the plant .	Marge Simpson
not the way i quit . ooh-who .	Homer Simpson
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , great story , lenny . but here 's one that 's even more spellbinding . once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison . and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph ...	Homer Simpson
... and he was a firm believer in fletcherism , and he played the organ , and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh , and his middle name was alva . and he never , ever , ever wore pajamas . and ...	Homer Simpson
well , i remember where edison worked . it was menlo park . that 's where he came up with the tasimeter , the ore separator and ...	Homer Simpson
that 's boring . you 're boring everybody . quit boring everyone !	Homer Simpson
... and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead . some kind of scary telephone i guess . or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell .	Homer Simpson
all right , already ! everyone knows the man accomplished a lot . maybe because he did n't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison !	Marge Simpson
ohh , that 's where you 're wrong , marge . he was a shameless self-promoter .	Homer Simpson
well , you 're not thomas edison .	Marge Simpson
marge , that 's it ! that 's why i have n't done anything with my life ! i need to be more like thomas edison !	Homer Simpson
whatever .	Marge Simpson
and i 'm starting right now . no more lousy pajamas !	Homer Simpson
from this day forward , i am an inventor !	Homer Simpson
well , i quit my job just like you said to .	Homer Simpson
i did n't tell you to quit your job .	Marge Simpson
yes , you did . i remember your exact words . you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you 'd torch the house .	Homer Simpson
at my age edison had already invented 203 things . ohh , i 've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him .	Homer Simpson
let 's see now ... inventions ... inventions ...	Homer Simpson
something electrical might be good .	Marge Simpson
what ? eh . eh . let me handle the creative end of this , marge . you do n't understand how the creative mind works like i do .	Homer Simpson
oh ?	Marge Simpson
you look at this table and what do you see ? just a table . now , a creative person , like me , looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables .	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's not a table , that 's our dryer .	Marge Simpson
my files !	Homer Simpson
uh , this is n't working . i 've got to try a different approach .	Homer Simpson
you 've started smoking , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
yes . thomas edison smoked several cigars a day .	Homer Simpson
yeah . he invented stuff , too .	Bart Simpson
shutup .	Homer Simpson
as long as you 're here annoying me , let 's have a brainstorming session . now , here 's how it works : lisa , you say one thing , then bart , you say another . just toss out things and i 'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea .	Homer Simpson
okay . umm ... automatic ...	Lisa Simpson
butt .	Bart Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
fluorescent ...	Lisa Simpson
booger .	Bart Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
a -- wait a minute ! these are n't exciting new products ! you 're not even trying . okay , that 's it . both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves .	Homer Simpson
lazy father ...	Lisa Simpson
ca n't even spank his own kids ...	Bart Simpson
homer ! you ca n't punish the children just because you ca n't come up with an idea .	Marge Simpson
i do n't see why not . they 're my kids . i own 'em .	Homer Simpson
okay , we own 'em .	Homer Simpson
what happened ? you did n't fall .	Marge Simpson
hm . i brought you a tuna sandwich . they say it 's brain food . i guess because there 's so much dolphin in it , and you know how smart they are .	Marge Simpson
ohhh , it 's no use . i ca n't work like this , cut off from the scientific community .	Homer Simpson
you stay here and guard the sandwich .	Homer Simpson
look , i just want to know how to invent things . tell me .	Homer Simpson
you mean like an electric blanketmobile ?	Homer Simpson
hamburger earmuffs !	Homer Simpson
thanks , sucker !	Homer Simpson
okay , i have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind .	Homer Simpson
first , my all-purpose electric hammer . `` for all your pounding needs . ''	Homer Simpson
ow !	Homer Simpson
probably needs to be more powerful .	Homer Simpson
i will buy ten of those right now .	Bart Simpson
now , here 's my `` everything 's okay '' alarm .	Homer Simpson
this will sound every three seconds unless something is n't okay .	Homer Simpson
turn it off , homer .	Marge Simpson
it ca n't be turned off .	Homer Simpson
but it does break easily . now this next one 's for the ladies . how many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting , only to realize you 're not wearing makeup ?	Homer Simpson
that 's every woman 's nightmare .	Marge Simpson
that 's why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun . it 's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready . close your eyes , marge .	Homer Simpson
and now you 're ready for a night on the town .	Homer Simpson
homer , you 've got it set on `` whore . ''	Marge Simpson
eh . oh . okay , this time try to keep your nostrils closed .	Homer Simpson
oh , look what you did . now i have to get my cold cream gun .	Homer Simpson
dad , women wo n't like being shot in the face .	Lisa Simpson
women will like what i tell them to like . now here 's something for everyone .	Homer Simpson
in the olden times , if you were watching tv and nature called , you 'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom . it was the hardest thing in the world to do . but now , with the lazy man reclining toilet chair , you can just lean back and let 'er rip .	Homer Simpson
you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms ?	Lisa Simpson
sure ! believe me , every man in america will want to have one .	Homer Simpson
gangway ! got ta poop .	Bart Simpson
no , bart . homer ... all these inventions , they 're ...	Marge Simpson
yes ?	Homer Simpson
they 're not very ...	Marge Simpson
yes ? yes ? yes ?	Homer Simpson
they 're terrible .	Marge Simpson
what ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm not saying you 're a bad inventor . i 'm just saying these particular inventions are awful , and no one in their right mind would buy them . or accept them as gifts .	Marge Simpson
but this is the best i could do . i guess i 'm no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson .	Homer Simpson
oh , dear . i hope i was n't too rough on him .	Marge Simpson
somebody had to tell him , mom . in the long run , it 's much kinder to --	Lisa Simpson
do you mind ?	Bart Simpson
all week , my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison , but now it 's over . i guess i 'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father .	Homer Simpson
homer ! / dad ! / look out !	Lisa Simpson
oh , that . i stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff .	Homer Simpson
they 're on hinges . that 's really ingenious , dad .	Lisa Simpson
it could save lives !	Marge Simpson
really ? you think it 's a good idea ?	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , safety sells . especially to lame-o 's .	Bart Simpson
i 'd buy one .	Marge Simpson
me , too !	Lisa Simpson
i did it ! i 'm gon na be rich !	Homer Simpson
look , mr. edison , i did it . i 'm an inventor ! and i owe it all to you .	Homer Simpson
see ? it 's just a regular chair , but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back ... kinda like the ones on the back of your ...	Homer Simpson
awdammit !	Homer Simpson
hey , dad , heard you swearing . mind if i join in ? crap . boobs . crap .	Bart Simpson
i thought i had a great idea , but i must 've seen it on this poster .	Homer Simpson
if edison thought of that chair , how come it 's not on this chart ?	Bart Simpson
it 's not ? maybe he never told anyone about it .	Homer Simpson
that chair might be the only one he made .	Homer Simpson
so ?	Bart Simpson
so , we 've got to go to the edison museum and smash it ! then i 'll be an inventor !	Homer Simpson
but i thought you loved edison .	Bart Simpson
aw , to hell with him !	Homer Simpson
yeah ! hell , damn , fart !	Bart Simpson
taking-bart-across-state-lines-back-soon .	Homer Simpson
i borrowed your wallet !	Homer Simpson
oh , i just mopped that driveway .	Marge Simpson
man , i ca n't wait to smash that chair .	Bart Simpson
oh , son , you 're young and headstrong , just like thomas edison , jr. you know , he started a mushroom farm , and an auto parts company , and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company . oh , and later , he raised turkeys . that was on his turkey farm .	Homer Simpson
all right ! the museum 's still open .	Bart Simpson
now let 's take care of business .	Homer Simpson
outta the way . this is one invention you 're not getting credit for , you inspiration hog !	Homer Simpson
your electric hammer , maestro ?	Bart Simpson
invent your way out of this , edison .	Homer Simpson
look , son . edison was just like me .	Homer Simpson
you mean the wild mood swings ?	Bart Simpson
no ! we both lived in another man 's shadow . this old-timey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache .	Homer Simpson
we 're not rivals . we 're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high . i ca n't destroy your work , my friend .	Homer Simpson
can i ?	Bart Simpson
no , but we 'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home ...	Homer Simpson
uh , i think that 's in italy , dad .	Bart Simpson
oh . well then , we 'll take it out on eli whitney .	Homer Simpson
yay ! / all right ! / woo-hoo ! /	Homer Simpson
that 's my tommy .	Homer Simpson

dad , that does n't belong to you .	Bart Simpson
but this might be my last chance to win one .	Homer Simpson
wally , i 'd be lying if i said i had n't .	Homer Simpson
what one ?	Homer Simpson
door ?	Homer Simpson
locked .	Marge Simpson
phone ?	Homer Simpson
unplugged .	Lisa Simpson
dog , cat ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i ca n't wait . look , marge , i had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place .	Homer Simpson
is n't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that were n't good enough for the fall schedule ?	Lisa Simpson
you 're thinking of all the other years . this year 's shows are classics .	Homer Simpson
there 's `` the laughter family . '' that 's animated . networks like animation 'cause they do n't have to pay the actors squat .	Homer Simpson
it 's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of admiral .	Marge Simpson
gee ... i never thought i 'd say this about a tv show , but this is kinda stupid . hey , `` policecops . '' that sounds like a lethal combination .	Homer Simpson
this is n't bad .	Bart Simpson
is n't bad ? tell me one thing mankind 's ever done that 's any better .	Homer Simpson
the renaissance .	Lisa Simpson
this is better .	Homer Simpson
he 's named like my name !	Homer Simpson
wow . they 've captured my personality perfectly . did you see the way daddy caught that bullet ?	Homer Simpson
that 's not really you , dad . he 's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name .	Lisa Simpson
do n't confuse daddy , lisa .	Homer Simpson
homer , it 's just a coincidence , like that guy named anthony michael hall who stole your car stereo .	Marge Simpson
right . coincidence .	Bart Simpson
another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name .	Marge Simpson
y'ello ... yes , this is the original homer simpson . who 's this ? ... the debbie pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school ? ... yes , i 'm still available .	Homer Simpson
no he 's not .	Marge Simpson
marge , that was debbie pinson . deb-bie pin-son .	Homer Simpson
no dating .	Marge Simpson
local man has same name . a tv character has the same name as springfield resident homer simpson .	Homer Simpson
and that 's the end of that chapter .	Homer Simpson
all right . and what 's the name ?	Homer Simpson
take it or leave it ... carl .	Homer Simpson
mmm , who knows ? maybe i 'll have to foil an assassination , or stop a peace conference .	Homer Simpson
yup . right down to the scarf .	Homer Simpson
hey , what 's going on ? that guy 's not homer simpson . he 's fat and stupid .	Homer Simpson
no , no , he ca n't be . i know , maybe he 's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots . yeah , that 's got ta be it .	Homer Simpson
shutup ! i 'm not your clown ! do n't diminish me !	Homer Simpson
gentlemen , i bid you --	Homer Simpson
who-o-oa ! who-o-oa ! who-o-oa !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't understand what happened . why did they change homer simpson 's character from cool to stupid ?	Homer Simpson
that does it ! there 's only one thing i can do .	Homer Simpson
the first episode was just a pilot , dad . producers fiddle with shows all the time . they change characters , drop others , and push some into the background .	Lisa Simpson
your character provides the comic relief . like ... ohhh ... marlon brando in `` apocalypse now . ''	Marge Simpson
i wish i had n't bought a hundred of these .	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen , but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show . now if you 'll excuse me , my fondue is just about ...	Homer Simpson
people are laughing at me , marge . let 's get outta here . forget the baby 's medicine .	Homer Simpson
but her forehead 's on fire .	Marge Simpson
fine . i 'll be in the car , driving home .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh , spaghetti-o 's .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , people . enough is enough .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
the whole town 's laughin ' at me . even that cat out there . bart , kill that cat !	Homer Simpson
okay .	Bart Simpson
and that big yellow flower .	Homer Simpson
homer , your growing insanity is starting to worry me . why do n't you talk to the producers of the show ? maybe they 'll make your character suave again .	Marge Simpson
hmmmm , i guess i could ... but while i 'm gone , keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there .	Homer Simpson
bart ?	Marge Simpson
yeah . `` bart . ''	Homer Simpson
uh , so , i just want to know how come you made your homer simpson character so ...	Homer Simpson
it better have .	Homer Simpson
who 's jeremy piven ?	Homer Simpson
policecops .	Homer Simpson
yeah , but why does the homer simpson character have to be so stupid ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm begging you . i 'm a human being . let me have my dignity back .	Homer Simpson
now he 's stupid and whiny .	Bart Simpson
your honor , i 'd like to sue the producers of `` policecops '' for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name .	Homer Simpson
then i 'd like to legally change my name .	Homer Simpson
any of these will be fine .	Homer Simpson
max power ? ?	Lisa Simpson
dynamic , is n't it ?	Homer Simpson
i love it , max .	Bart Simpson
you changed your name without consulting me ?	Marge Simpson
that 's the way max power is , marge . decisive , uncompromising , and rude .	Homer Simpson
but this will be so confusing . the mailman wo n't know what to do . did you think of the mailman at all before you did this ?	Marge Simpson
yes , briefly .	Homer Simpson
and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what ?	Marge Simpson
oh honey , they have acids that can burn that off .	Homer Simpson
but i fell in love with homer simpson . i do n't want to snuggle with `` max power . ''	Marge Simpson
nobody snuggles with max power . you strap yourself in and feel the g 's .	Homer Simpson
oh , lord .	Marge Simpson
and it does n't stop in the bedroom . oh no , i 'm taking charge . kids , there 's three ways to do things -- the right way , the wrong way , and the max power way .	Homer Simpson
is n't that the wrong way ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , but faster .	Homer Simpson
we should really put that in the corner .	Lisa Simpson
max power / he 's the man / whose name you 'd love to touch / but you must n't touch / his name sounds good in your ear / but when you say it , you must n't fear / 'cause his name can be said by anyone ...	Homer Simpson
you remembered my name !	Homer Simpson
mr. power .	Homer Simpson
so i want the monogram to read m-a-x p-o-w-	Homer Simpson
max power does n't abbreviate . each letter is as important as the one that preceded it . maybe more important . no , as important .	Homer Simpson
and if you have enough room , add some exclamation points and a pirate flag .	Homer Simpson
just takin ' care of business .	Homer Simpson
homer sim -- uh , max power .	Homer Simpson
yeah , is n't it ? i got it off a hair dryer .	Homer Simpson
yeah , but i usually have three or four .	Homer Simpson
tie good . you like shirt ?	Homer Simpson
marge , this is thai food . from now on , i want it morning , noon and night .	Homer Simpson
when did you start liking thai food ?	Marge Simpson
when trent steel bought me some .	Homer Simpson
who 's trent steel ?	Marge Simpson
he 's max power 's oldest and dearest friend .	Homer Simpson
what 's this wrapped in a banana leaf ? mmm , smells like mint .	Lisa Simpson
oh , i spit my gum in there .	Homer Simpson
eww .	Lisa Simpson
where 'd you meet this trent steel ? moe 's ?	Marge Simpson
no way , this guy 's a winner . he has a company that makes computers , or a computer that makes companies ... anyway , you would n't understand .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess your new name is really opening doors for you .	Marge Simpson
for all of us . look .	Homer Simpson
you are invited to a garden party this saturday !	Marge Simpson
this is our chance to rub elbows with springfield 's young , hip power couples ... like me and debbie pinson .	Homer Simpson

you gave away my room !	Lisa Simpson
come on , lisa , try and see this from the omnitouch corporation 's point of view .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you did this , dad . why did n't you put that thing in your room ?	Lisa Simpson
hm . that thought never occurred to me . funny how your mind works in a crisis .	Homer Simpson
it 's just until we pay off daddy 's desecration of a priceless artifact . i thought i 'd never have to say that again .	Marge Simpson
but where am i supposed to live ? !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , what 's your favorite movie ?	Homer Simpson

i just want to study .	Lisa Simpson

great . maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk .	Homer Simpson
sounds great .	Lisa Simpson
well , that 's a relief .	Homer Simpson
give it a try , honey .	Homer Simpson
i 'm really not the chuckling type .	Lisa Simpson
it 's true . i 'm always making clever noises , and she never chuckles at 'em .	Homer Simpson
yeah , ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --	Lisa Simpson
oh , no you do n't . screw that touchy , queery crap ! we 'll take the harsh antacids . nothing 's too good for my little girl .	Homer Simpson
i sure settled his hash . imagine that quack thinking you 'd try one of those crazy new-age cures .	Homer Simpson
they 're not all crazy , dad .	Lisa Simpson
sure they are , honey .	Homer Simpson
you know , just because you say something is crazy , does n't make it so . and just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun , does n't make that true either !	Lisa Simpson

marge , i 've screwed up everything i 've ever done . i mean , look at bart . but i finally found something where people worship me for screwing up . and that feels pretty good .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess nothing else matters as long as you 're happy .	Marge Simpson
now you 're making sense . good night .	Homer Simpson
i give you `` botched hibachi . '' the tricycle is on loan from the maggie simpson collection .	Homer Simpson

you can call him ray / or you can call him j . / or you can call him ray j . / but you does n't have to call him ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm sick of him already .	Lisa Simpson
the point is , great artists are always trying new things , like michelangelo or shaquille o'neal . you just need some inspiration .	Marge Simpson
it 's so exciting to do something cultural together .	Marge Simpson
matt groening ? what 's he doing in a museum ? he can barely draw .	Homer Simpson

no , christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects . he once wrapped the reichstag in plastic .	Lisa Simpson
not the reichstag !	Homer Simpson
oh , yes , and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the california highway ...	Lisa Simpson

oooh , they got our number .	Homer Simpson
one square watermelon please .	Homer Simpson

at least the jimmy stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan .	Homer Simpson
shh !	Marge Simpson
well , that was a stinker .	Homer Simpson
i liked it . it was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words , instead of bullets and chasing .	Marge Simpson
oh , you 're just saying that because your `` boyfriend '' was in it . i 'll bet you would 've hated it if me and lenny were mr. smith .	Homer Simpson
will you stop acting so jealous ?	Marge Simpson
um , will you be reading the cards yourself , mel ?	Marge Simpson
oh , that 's it ! i 'm telling mr. stupidest man alive what i really thought of his movie ! hey , gibson !	Homer Simpson

ah-ah-ah ! now here 's your biggest problem of all ...	Homer Simpson
and it was fine for the 1930 's . the country was doing great back then . everyone was into talking . but now , in whatever year this is , the audience wants action ! and seats with beverage holders , but mainly action .	Homer Simpson
oh ! mel , it 's the most boring piece of garbage i 've ever seen . and it 's not easy for me to say that .	Homer Simpson
it was symbolism . he was mad .	Homer Simpson
piece o ' cake . now where 's that kid with my latte ?	Homer Simpson
according to the map , this house is owned by the dog from `` frasier . '' and that 's where ellen degeneres and anne heche live .	Marge Simpson

i 'm tired of running away . did `` braveheart '' run away ? did `` payback '' run away ? it 's time we showed those suits what we 're made of .	Homer Simpson

i 've given out my share of bad reviews .	Homer Simpson
it lost some points 'cause it had a hot wheel on it .	Homer Simpson
oh , that 's classic .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
hm . this pea soup is as weak as the acting , and nowhere near as hammy .	Homer Simpson
dad , that 's so mean .	Lisa Simpson
the other critics told me to be mean . and you should always give in to peer pressure .	Homer Simpson
but what if someone bad tells me to ...	Lisa Simpson

to make sure that no one knows that you 're dead . and if anyone asks ... you 're not dead .	Homer Simpson
hey maude ! look who 's helping me clean the chimney .	Homer Simpson
hi , maude . diddily . i 've been having fun with my pal homer . diddily .	Homer Simpson

hello , kitty .	Homer Simpson
you little scamp .	Homer Simpson
are we really gon na live here and grow crops ?	Lisa Simpson
absolutely . this is our big chance . the simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins .	Homer Simpson
i 'll dig an outhouse .	Bart Simpson
i 'll weed the floor .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll repress the rage i 'm feeling .	Marge Simpson
that 's my girl . let the agriculture begin !	Homer Simpson
all right , let 's see what the old girl can do .	Homer Simpson
it does n't sound very tractor-y .	Bart Simpson
hang on .	Homer Simpson
and ... there .	Homer Simpson

lassie ?	Bart Simpson
oh , you poor little sheep ! no one 's sheared you for years !	Lisa Simpson

this car was made in guatemala .	Homer Simpson
i bought these shoes from a hobo .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , i believe in good grooming .	Homer Simpson
aw , what do you know ?	Homer Simpson
oh , that 's just superstition .	Homer Simpson
you watch me . i 'll grow something out there .	Homer Simpson
wow , dad , this is the juiciest watermelon i ever tasted .	Bart Simpson
yeah , i hope i can grow some like that .	Homer Simpson
what are you planting ?	Bart Simpson
oh , a little bit of everything .	Homer Simpson
something will thrive in this harsh , merciless soil .	Homer Simpson
and for those who face nature unafraid , it is they who reap the ... ah ... i 'm down .	Homer Simpson
paw !	Bart Simpson
move the handbrake ...	Homer Simpson
ohhh , that 's heaven .	Homer Simpson
oh , it 's been a month . why wo n't anything grow ?	Homer Simpson
maybe it needs more fertilizer .	Marge Simpson
i 'm only one man , marge .	Homer Simpson
well , it 's probably just a bad growing season .	Marge Simpson
oh , who am i kidding ? i 'm no farmer .	Homer Simpson
leave me alone , you big bully .	Homer Simpson
more tumbleweed , lisa ?	Marge Simpson
no thanks . i 'm still finishing my thistles .	Lisa Simpson
dad , if we leave for town right now , we can catch the dinner special at krusty-burger .	Bart Simpson
sorry , boy . going back to springfield would be a coward 's way out .	Homer Simpson
was n't skipping town in the first place a coward 's way out ?	Bart Simpson
oh , you 're right . i 'm a coward . i 've made such a mess of things . if only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow ...	Homer Simpson
wait a minute .	Homer Simpson
easy ... careful ... steady ...	Homer Simpson
time to give mother nature a little goose .	Homer Simpson
well , marge , have you ever seen a field glow like that ?	Homer Simpson
it 's eerily beautiful , but are you sure this is safe ?	Marge Simpson
of course not . but you know something ? sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart .	Homer Simpson
you got that from a movie poster !	Marge Simpson
well , when there 's nothing left to believe in , believe in hope .	Homer Simpson
where 'd you get that ?	Marge Simpson
from the producers of `` waiting to exhale . ''	Homer Simpson
is that plutonium on your gums ?	Marge Simpson
shut up and kiss me .	Homer Simpson
it 's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop !	Homer Simpson
but it 's only been one night .	Marge Simpson
that 's all it takes . if we learned one thing from `` the amazing colossal man , '' and `` grasshopperus , '' it 's that radiation makes stuff grow real big , real fast .	Homer Simpson
yeah , but did n't grasshopperus kill chad everett ?	Marge Simpson
only 'cause he tried to reason with him .	Homer Simpson
oh .	Marge Simpson
brace yourselves , everybody . you 're about to see the hugest , juiciest , possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known . you might want to crane your necks upward now to save time .	Homer Simpson
ta-da !	Homer Simpson
all right , now do n't panic . it 's possible the giant vegetables are invisible .	Homer Simpson
ah-ha !	Homer Simpson
oh ... where are you ?	Homer Simpson
oh , honey , give it up .	Marge Simpson
oh , you 're right . this farm 's hopeless . why did n't i listen to those inbred hicks ? i guess i 'll just go hang myself in the barn .	Homer Simpson
homer , no !	Marge Simpson
let 'im go , mom .	Bart Simpson
wait , dad , you do n't have to kill yourself .	Lisa Simpson
this better be good .	Homer Simpson
something 's growing .	Lisa Simpson
a sprout !	Homer Simpson
and there 's some more !	Homer Simpson
what is it ? carrots ? peas ? maybe it 's okra .	Marge Simpson
who cares what it is ? it 's growing ! i 've saved the farm !	Homer Simpson
look at my babies . this tomato will be heinz ketchup . and this to-mah-to will be hunt 's catsup .	Homer Simpson
bup , no fighting , boys .	Homer Simpson
bleh ! tastes like cigarette butts .	Bart Simpson
that 's odd . the outside looks like a tomato , but the inside is brown .	Marge Simpson
maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds .	Lisa Simpson
oh , great . i got a field full of mutants .	Homer Simpson
gim me ! i want more !	Bart Simpson
i thought you said it tasted terrible .	Lisa Simpson
it does . but it 's smooth and mild . and refreshingly addictive .	Bart Simpson
addictive , eh ?	Homer Simpson
`` tomacco ? '' that 's pretty clever , dad . i mean , for a product that 's evil and deadly .	Lisa Simpson
aw , thanks honey .	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine , but it is very nice to see bart eating his vegetables .	Marge Simpson
yes , it 's the latest craze . try some , wo n't you ?	Homer Simpson
can i interest you in a mincemeat pie ? there very ...	Marge Simpson
no , but i use only the fre ...	Marge Simpson
do n't push . there 's plenty of tomacco for everyone .	Homer Simpson
have your cash or food stamps ready !	Bart Simpson
do n't forget your mincemeat pie !	Marge Simpson
you 're scaring the customers , honey .	Homer Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
those dirty rotten ...	Homer Simpson
i wish i could make a difference , lisa , but i 'm just one man .	Homer Simpson
how much ?	Homer Simpson
one hundred and ... may i speak to my family for a moment ?	Homer Simpson
did you see the way emile 's lookin ' at mindy ? hoo-hoo , i think something 's going on there .	Homer Simpson
should n't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer ?	Marge Simpson
oh , yeah . let 's take it .	Homer Simpson
dad , it 's a tobacco company . they make billions off the suffering and deaths of others .	Lisa Simpson
she 's right , dad . they can afford a lot more .	Bart Simpson
no , i ...	Lisa Simpson
i 'm with lisa . let 's take 'em to the cleaners .	Marge Simpson
we all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult . the least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion .	Homer Simpson
they 'll be back . we control the world 's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from ...	Homer Simpson
stop eating our future !	Homer Simpson
get the ... get outta ... bad animals ! go home !	Homer Simpson
thank god , there 's one left !	Homer Simpson
look , a flying saucer !	Homer Simpson
there , there . we had quite a scare today . but you 're gon na make us millions . yes you are .	Homer Simpson
you 're about to launch a terrible evil on the world . you 've got ta destroy this plant .	Lisa Simpson
i know , honey . but what can i do , as an individual ? i would n't know where to begin .	Homer Simpson
just burn that plant right now and end this madness .	Lisa Simpson
i agree , but how ?	Homer Simpson
they 're after the tomacco !	Homer Simpson
now you ca n't tell me nicotine 's not addictive .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , there 's absolutely no evidence this is ...	Homer Simpson
give them the plant , homer !	Marge Simpson
no , i 'd rather die !	Homer Simpson
take it !	Homer Simpson
so , mindy ? how did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million ?	Homer Simpson
cash 'll be okay ! or stock ? does your company have stock ?	Homer Simpson
mindy ?	Homer Simpson
mindy and i are just hammering out a payment plan . we 'll talk monday !	Homer Simpson
i 've never been so glad to be home .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know why we ever left in the first place .	Homer Simpson
it certainly is . why do n't you put down your gun and have a slice ?	Marge Simpson
hey , are we duellin ' or what ?	Homer Simpson
you okay , dad ?	Bart Simpson
i think so . the bone stopped the bullet .	Homer Simpson
dad , this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for .	Lisa Simpson
after pie .	Homer Simpson
snooze ... need more snooze .	Homer Simpson
num num , maggie . num num .	Marge Simpson
did somebody say num num ?	Homer Simpson
i ca n't get maggie to eat . maybe if you try ...	Marge Simpson
oh , i 'm twenty-six hours late for work . no time for maggie .	Homer Simpson
oooh , where 's waldo ?	Homer Simpson
nope . nope . this would be a lot easier without all these people . nope . nope . it 's there -- uh , nope .	Homer Simpson

at least you do n't have to feed any of the stuff i bought at the fair . well , except the mop .	Marge Simpson
marge , your pro-mop , anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time . but do n't worry , i have a way for duncan to earn his keep .	Homer Simpson
mmm , that 's terrific , duncan . you 're ten for ten . now , let 's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the nfl .	Homer Simpson

honey , do n't get obsessed with that . focus on the good things . like this fire extinguisher i got at the fair .	Marge Simpson
really -- hey , what are you doing ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both lynda carter and george foreman .	Marge Simpson
i wonder what would happen if they had a baby ?	Marge Simpson
dad , if we 're gon na race duncan , should n't we hire a professional trainer ?	Bart Simpson
son , i learned everything i needed to know from `` the horse whisperer '' . step one : seduce a lonely housewife .	Homer Simpson
ma'am .	Homer Simpson

when the race starts , run really fast !	Homer Simpson
champion horse , coming through !	Homer Simpson

hello , i 'd like to speak to president clinton , please . i wrote to him and he never wrote back ... no , i do n't want al gore !	Lisa Simpson

is that duncan ?	Lisa Simpson
not anymore . ladies , say hello to ...	Homer Simpson
furious d ?	Marge Simpson
he 's the bad boy of racing . he 's got attitude and bad-itude , so show him some latitude and you 'll win his gratitude . only in america !	Bart Simpson

what do you want me to do ?	Homer Simpson
my horse must lose ?	Homer Simpson
and what if i refuse to lose ?	Homer Simpson
my horse must lose !	Homer Simpson
did that really happen ? or was it just a wonderful dream ?	Homer Simpson
son , do n't ask why , but you have to lose the big race .	Homer Simpson
you want me to lose the springfield derby ? but you always taught me that winning was everything .	Bart Simpson
oh , it is , it is . but we 've been pushing that poor horse too hard .	Homer Simpson
maybe . but if duncan wins the derby , he can spend the rest of his days as a stud .	Bart Simpson
well , it is a good life , believe me ... all right , we 'll give it a shot . i 'll deal with those murderous trolls .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Bart Simpson
i mean , i 'll deal with those murderous trolls .	Homer Simpson

oh my god , it 's a racetrack !	Bart Simpson
the bird sanctuary -- they ruined it !	Lisa Simpson
no they did n't . they just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate , or a monkey in a cowboy suit .	Homer Simpson
see ? animals can get used to anything .	Homer Simpson

now , now , now . do n't beat yourself up . i 'm the one who drove her out of her seat . i 'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts . i 'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation ...	Homer Simpson

from now on , one of us always stays home .	Marge Simpson
agreed .	Lisa Simpson
will cash be okay ?	Homer Simpson
well , then we 've got a problem . the banks are closed by now .	Homer Simpson
maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours , but we in springfield are simple folk . we like our cars fast , and our banks closed . okay , fine , we 'll go down there . but they 're not going to be open .	Homer Simpson

now , let 's open it up to some q & a .	Homer Simpson
yes , lisa junior ?	Homer Simpson
well , not the unitarians . if that 's the one true faith , i 'll eat my hat .	Homer Simpson
well , ak , it 's because god is powerful , but also insecure , like barbra streisand , before james brolin . oh , he 's been a rock .	Homer Simpson
oh , who am i kidding ? the truth is , i 'm no missionary . i work in a nuclear power plant .	Homer Simpson
look , the point is , i want to help , but you do n't need a well , or a chapel , or an immunization center . what you need 's a little razzle dazzle . qtoktok , are you thinking what i 'm thinking ?	Homer Simpson

oh ! what 's that awful sound ?	Homer Simpson
the furnace ?	Marge Simpson
it 's me !	Lisa Simpson
awww ...	Marge Simpson
the cat dances better than i do .	Lisa Simpson

excuse me ...	Lisa Simpson
why is n't my name in the program ?	Lisa Simpson
curtain puller ? !	Lisa Simpson
but my parents are counting on seeing me dance ! and i 've worked ever so hard .	Lisa Simpson
all right , i 'll be the stupid curtain puller .	Lisa Simpson
i get your pull-a-pull-a-pull-a ...	Lisa Simpson
most entertaining , but how does that help me ?	Lisa Simpson
ohhhhhh . that 's brilliant , professor ! what will you think of next ?	Lisa Simpson
i 've got ta go now .	Lisa Simpson

i ca n't help it ! it 's the shoes !	Lisa Simpson
oh , please stop !	Lisa Simpson

go , lisa ! c'mon , everybody , give it up for my little girl !	Homer Simpson
lisa 's gone berserk ! do something , homer ! do something !	Marge Simpson
oh , thanks , dad .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't think , i just acted .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , vicki . i just wanted to be a dancer so badly .	Lisa Simpson
you mean i danced all by myself ?	Lisa Simpson
see , honey ? all you needed was to believe in ...	Marge Simpson
what are you talking about , professor frink ? they 're clearly in the `` on '' position . see ? `` on . ''	Homer Simpson
oh . ohhhhh . well , now that i look even closer ...	Homer Simpson
forget it , dad . i guess i 'm never gon na be your broadway baby .	Lisa Simpson
that 's not true , honey . you can always write a depressing broadway play of some kind .	Homer Simpson
you think so ?	Lisa Simpson
sure . it could be a story about people coming to terms with things .	Marge Simpson
hey , yeah . you could load it up with lots of swears . that 's what david mamet does .	Homer Simpson
oh , i love you guys .	Lisa Simpson
why ? it 's just a cute little weasel . hello there , mister weasel .	Homer Simpson
i 'm down .	Homer Simpson
tonight , on the discovery channel : `` inside lisa 's nose . ''	Bart Simpson
what will we find ? boogers ... or nazi gold ?	Bart Simpson
bart , quit it !	Lisa Simpson
no way .	Bart Simpson
bart sleeps with raggedy andy .	Lisa Simpson
cut ! cut ! cut !	Bart Simpson
otto , a red traffic light means what ?	Bart Simpson
otto , since when have you had a girlfriend ?	Bart Simpson
homer , look , we 're invited to otto 's wedding !	Marge Simpson
ooh , and such delicate tissue paper . zig-zag ! ?	Marge Simpson
ow ! ow ! ow ! ow ! ow ! ow ! ow ! ow !	Homer Simpson
no knife games on the kitchen table !	Marge Simpson
i did n't hit your precious table .	Homer Simpson
ooh , we 're `` cordially '' invited ... this saturday ... to join otto and becky at ... 742 evergreen terrace ? that 's our address !	Marge Simpson
i told otto he could have the wedding here . hope that 's okay .	Bart Simpson
you should have asked first , bart . weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars .	Marge Simpson
hey , it 'll be easy . you 've still got most of the stuff from apu 's wedding back there .	Bart Simpson
all right , otto can get married here . but homer , you have to get rid of that elephant .	Marge Simpson
let 's see . candles , flowers , place cards , rice ...	Marge Simpson
oh , mom , you 're not supposed to throw rice anymore . birds eat it , their stomachs swell and they explode .	Lisa Simpson
why am i just learning this now ?	Bart Simpson
they 're pigs ?	Lisa Simpson
so , any words for the bride and groom ?	Bart Simpson
you do n't seem to be trying very hard .	Bart Simpson
dad , the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake !	Lisa Simpson
oh , that 's just superstition .	Homer Simpson
thank you .	Lisa Simpson
oh , becky , you look beautiful . i thought you might want to see this bridal magazine . it 's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage . all `` don'ts . ''	Marge Simpson
well , the real key , according to sexperts , is mutual interests .	Marge Simpson
mm-hmm ?	Marge Simpson
oh , you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging . make it part of the background noise of your relationship . that 's how i polished homer into the perfect ... homer ! no , that 's ice !	Marge Simpson
let me talk to otto .	Marge Simpson
well , it does n't have to be . otto 's just going to have to decide what 's more important , his heavy metal or you .	Marge Simpson
becky , what have i done here ? i 'm so sorry .	Marge Simpson
in about fifteen minutes i 'd take off that wedding dress , or you 're gon na look crazy .	Homer Simpson
moe , can i give you some shrimp for the road ?	Lisa Simpson
becky , i know you must feel awful . but at least this did n't happen after you were married .	Marge Simpson
yes , better now than when you 're too old and fat to get another man .	Homer Simpson
hey , why do n't you stay with us ?	Bart Simpson
bart , remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house ?	Marge Simpson
remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people 's weddings ?	Homer Simpson
it 's settled . the stranger stays with us !	Homer Simpson
ch-ch-ch-changes / time to change the oil / yeah / changes / do n't wan na be an oily man /	Homer Simpson
a man innocently changes his oil , when ... a two-ton car comes crashing down !	Bart Simpson
crashing down !	Bart Simpson
who 'd have thought you could hold up a car with a wicker basket ?	Bart Simpson
now , lisa 's going through this phase where she does n't eat any meat . so i usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables .	Marge Simpson
nobody 's ever called my gravy yummers before !	Marge Simpson
ooo , ooo , i 've always wanted to use rosemary in something .	Marge Simpson
mom , this gravy tastes better than god 's sweat .	Bart Simpson
thanks to our own spice girl : becky .	Marge Simpson
well , mom , you really brought out the mung in these beans .	Lisa Simpson
actually , that was becky , too .	Marge Simpson
what are these things in the mashed potatoes ?	Homer Simpson
well , nobody 's perfect . let me just pick those out .	Marge Simpson
no ! oh , becky , your potatoes are the best i 've ever had .	Homer Simpson
oh , god .	Homer Simpson
stop kicking my baby !	Marge Simpson
yeah , mom . i need something great . milhouse has footage of himself falling down the stairs .	Bart Simpson
well , no kicking . it 's too dangerous .	Marge Simpson
that 's very impressive , but i still do n't ... stop that !	Marge Simpson
hello . hel-looo .	Marge Simpson
we 're jamming , mom . she 's painting my music , and i 'm playing to her painting .	Lisa Simpson
is n't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house ?	Lisa Simpson
yes . well , i guess i 'll go roll socks . it 's not `` hip , '' but it has to be done .	Marge Simpson
it 's red !	Marge Simpson
yes , i hate when things get worn out ... hmm ... socks ... welcomes ...	Marge Simpson
... she 's so helpful and everyone loves her and , well , this may sound crazy , but i think my family likes becky more than me .	Marge Simpson
really ?	Marge Simpson
dead in a week ? what are you talking about ?	Marge Simpson
that was a movie .	Marge Simpson
becky 's going to seduce homer ?	Marge Simpson
it 's my favorite !	Lisa Simpson
it is ?	Marge Simpson
be right back .	Marge Simpson
take your time !	Homer Simpson
why do i always think of the perfect thing to say when it 's too late : `` shut up , becky ! '' ooh , that would 've been sweet .	Marge Simpson
oh , no . the `` brakes cut '' light .	Marge Simpson
why would i do that ?	Marge Simpson
that 's crazy .	Marge Simpson
look , i know i do n't have any proof , but this woman is trying to kill me !	Marge Simpson
do i have to be dead before you 'll help me ?	Marge Simpson
c'mon , becky . tell us your big news .	Lisa Simpson
awww . / oh , no .	Lisa Simpson
becky , i think i speak for all of us when i say `` when 's the ice cream gon na get here ? ''	Homer Simpson
relax , he 's gorging .	Bart Simpson
okay , maybe not .	Bart Simpson
usurper ! usurper ! usurper !	Marge Simpson
do n't mess with me , i 've got jimmies !	Marge Simpson
shut up , becky ! there . i finally said it .	Marge Simpson
i thought you said the law was powerless .	Marge Simpson
this is n't over , becky . i know where you live : my house !	Marge Simpson
poor maggie . how many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life ?	Lisa Simpson
yes .	Marge Simpson
it was healthy . he reciprocated . he reciprocated !	Marge Simpson
oh ... i was just praying to god that you 'll find me sane .	Marge Simpson
oh , yes . he 's kind of everywhere .	Marge Simpson
i 'm not insane !	Marge Simpson
i 'm not insane !	Marge Simpson
run , marge , run ! pump those crazy legs !	Homer Simpson
kills again ? she has n't killed once !	Bart Simpson
should n't we be out there trying to find her ?	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry , she 'll show up here sooner or later . to finish off becky . then we 'll have mommy back .	Homer Simpson
too soon .	Bart Simpson
oh , i really miss mom .	Lisa Simpson
the kids are saying if you say bloody margie five times , she 'll appear . but then she gouges your eyes out .	Bart Simpson
i heard she mates with men , then eats them .	Homer Simpson
now , let 's find out who this becky really is .	Marge Simpson
i really should read the whole headline before i react .	Marge Simpson
oh , my . i 've been so unfair to becky . maybe i am insane . i mean , i am talking to myself .	Marge Simpson
becky , i want to apologize to you ... surper !	Marge Simpson
why you little ... !	Marge Simpson
cut ! cut !	Bart Simpson
mom , it 's great to have you back , but you walked right into my shot .	Bart Simpson
shot ? wha ?	Marge Simpson
and i 'm directing the `` making of '' video .	Lisa Simpson
oh . well , then , i guess there 's a reasonable explanation for everything . except you cutting my brakes !	Marge Simpson
oh , about that . uh -- when i changed your oil , i may have drained your brake fluid . i did n't say anything 'cause i thought you 'd be mad .	Homer Simpson
ooboy , my bad . becky , i 'm so sorry i accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family .	Marge Simpson
well , that 's a relief , too , knowing i 'm not crazy . so i guess everything really worked out for the --	Marge Simpson
mom !	Bart Simpson
you monsters ! you 've killed her !	Homer Simpson
no they did n't .	Marge Simpson
oh , i 've got too much to do to take a nap right now . lisa , get maggie out of that cage . and homer , since you 're dressed for it , i got some s & m for ya : scrubbing and mopping .	Marge Simpson
thank you .	Homer Simpson
everybody wanted a piece of us .	Homer Simpson
they told us what to wear , how to dress , which clothes we should put on ...	Marge Simpson
the cops found me driving on the sidewalk .	Bart Simpson
i had no business hosting the oscars . after the show , meryl streep spit on me .	Lisa Simpson
nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids . they almost drove me to fortified wine !	Marge Simpson
then we figured out we could park them in front of the tv . that 's how i was raised , and i turned out tv .	Homer Simpson
our favorite show was `` hollywood hogwash . '' but we also loved `` the dreck squad '' ...	Homer Simpson
`` the malarkeys , '' `` dumbin ' it down '' ...	Marge Simpson
sheriff lowbrow ...	Lisa Simpson
home improvement ...	Bart Simpson
but we never saw people like us on tv .	Homer Simpson
tv families were always hugging and tackling issues .	Bart Simpson
homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show . finally , i said , `` so , do it ! either shit or get off the pot . ''	Marge Simpson
`` my funny family , '' take one .	Homer Simpson
aannnd action !	Homer Simpson
honey , i 'm home ! the boss is coming to dinner and i need a clean shirt .	Homer Simpson
i have n't done the laundry yet .	Marge Simpson
mamma mia ! now i 'll have to do it .	Homer Simpson
dad , that 's too much deterge --	Lisa Simpson
not now . i 'm busy turning on this washing machine .	Homer Simpson
simp-son ! ! ! where 's my dinner ? !	Bart Simpson
mamma mia !	Homer Simpson
it was amazing how fast dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show .	Lisa Simpson
okay , the material was a little corny , but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen .	Marge Simpson
every day i thought about firing marge . you know , just to shake things up .	Homer Simpson
shut up all of you , or i 'll sue .	Lisa Simpson
fortunately , i had a network connection . the man who cut my hair was also president of fox .	Marge Simpson
... m-e-r. okay .	Homer Simpson
you 're almost there .	Homer Simpson
good .	Homer Simpson
i first knew the show was a hit when i walked into school , and a kid was wearing a bart simpson t-shirt .	Bart Simpson
fox had an endless supply of clever slogans , man .	Bart Simpson
suddenly , i was invited to every birthday party . sometimes i 'd have to read the cake just to know who i was singing to .	Lisa Simpson
the funniest stuff came right out of real life .	Bart Simpson
son , let 's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes .	Homer Simpson
cowabunga , dude !	Bart Simpson
dad , i 've never said `` cowabunga ! '' in my life . your script sucks .	Bart Simpson
why you little ... !	Homer Simpson
and that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags .	Homer Simpson
we were using fifty-dollar bills as toilet paper . and toilet paper as dog toilet paper .	Marge Simpson
we found a secret room that was filled to the ceiling with parachute pants . i 'm wearing some now .	Bart Simpson
none of us had ever sung before . but mr. geffen believed in us .	Lisa Simpson
i want to set the record straight . i thought the cop was a prostitute .	Homer Simpson
hello , mister lobster .	Homer Simpson
wow ...	Lisa Simpson
the script originally called for me to jump the gorge . but i 'd been up all night paying people to kiss , so dad volunteered to do the stunt .	Bart Simpson
everything was goin ' great at first . i felt like i was king of the world .	Homer Simpson
i 'm king of the world ! woo hoo ! woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
right about here , i realize something 's wrong .	Homer Simpson
yep , there i go . then came the rocks . jagged rocks . hitting me with their jags .	Homer Simpson
oh , my leg ! this is the worst pain ever ! stop pummeling me ! it 's really painful ! owww !	Homer Simpson
why did i take such punishment ? let 's just say that fame was like a drug . but what was even more like a drug was the drugs .	Homer Simpson
it was such an honor to be on the walk of fame . i mean , there we were with hollywood royalty , like milton berle and nelson mandela .	Lisa Simpson
... and just a few stars down from the cheerios honey bee .	Marge Simpson
we were earning millions , but we were always strapped for cash .	Lisa Simpson
i learned something : when people reach for their diaphragm , they do n't want to see my picture .	Marge Simpson
hey , they ca n't take our house . my pot-bellied pig is in there .	Homer Simpson
ohhhh , mister . porky .	Homer Simpson
fine ! i 'll do `` teen wolf iii . '' i 've got fair-weather friends to feed .	Bart Simpson
dad , i want to go to bed . are n't there child labor laws ?	Lisa Simpson
who told you about those laws ? was it marge ?	Homer Simpson
hey , you 've been riding me all day . why do n't you poop in your hat ?	Marge Simpson
bart , what do you mean , you have jury duty ?	Marge Simpson
right from the start , i had a bad feeling about that gig .	Lisa Simpson
helloooo , iowa ! does anyone have a donut ?	Homer Simpson
now homer , this is no time to be thinking about food .	Marge Simpson
yeah , forget the donuts ! we 're here to go-nuts ! musically , that is !	Bart Simpson
what kind of song should we play ?	Lisa Simpson
something that swings , with the beat of new orleans .	Marge Simpson
no , something that rocks . that 's the sound of today .	Homer Simpson
swings !	Marge Simpson
rocks !	Homer Simpson
swings !	Lisa Simpson
rocks !	Bart Simpson
swings !	Lisa Simpson
rocks !	Bart Simpson
i 'll kill you !	Homer Simpson
you do n't have the guts , little man !	Marge Simpson
folks , we 're just having a little family tiff . if you 'll just bear with us ...	Lisa Simpson
oh , shut up ! always trying to act so mature ... i 'm glad you make the least money .	Bart Simpson
oh , that 's it !	Lisa Simpson
hey , hey , stop it !	Homer Simpson
stop it !	Marge Simpson
who are you ! i 'll get you !	Homer Simpson
that slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing . it gave us a chance to pursue solo projects . i returned to my first love , the legitimate theater .	Homer Simpson
where is the rent ? / i must have the rent ! / dollars , dimes and nickels / i need them all right now !	Homer Simpson
i literally chewed the scenery .	Homer Simpson
if esposito thinks he 's going to muscle us , he 's wrong .	Bart Simpson
i shot the sheriff / but i did not shoot the dep-u-ty	Marge Simpson
so , the next time you see a sheriff , shoot him ...	Marge Simpson
... a smile .	Marge Simpson
good night , laughlin !	Marge Simpson
to prolong the run of the series , i was secretly given anti-growth hormones .	Lisa Simpson
that 's ridiculous ! how could i even get all five necessary drops into her cereal ?	Homer Simpson
what ?	Homer Simpson
so , uh , how 's everybody doing ?	Homer Simpson
oh , save it for your next book , you little snitch !	Marge Simpson
it was the best thanksgiving ever . i mean , emotionally , it was terrible . but the turkey was so moist .	Homer Simpson
when willie asked me to be a presenter at the new awareness awards , i had to think about it ... for about a microsecond .	Bart Simpson
you just do n't say no to the redheaded stranger . and when i heard it was for awareness , that sealed the deal .	Marge Simpson
hi !	Homer Simpson
what ? ! what 's she doing here ?	Homer Simpson
hey , what 's goin ' on ?	Lisa Simpson
so this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together .	Lisa Simpson
yes , go on .	Homer Simpson
we put all the craziness behind us , and now it 's time to get back to what matters : the show , and the sunday comic strip .	Homer Simpson
... which homer writes himself .	Marge Simpson
so you know it 's great .	Bart Simpson
why you little ... !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe it . we won another contest !	Marge Simpson
the simpsons are going to delaware !	Homer Simpson
i wan na see wilmington !	Lisa Simpson
i wan na visit a screen door factory !	Bart Simpson
this 'll be the last season .	Homer Simpson
hey , who cut out beetle bailey ? i need my miss buxley fix .	Homer Simpson
i do n't like you ogling her .	Marge Simpson
why do n't you read `` cathy '' ? she 's hilarious .	Marge Simpson
eh , too much baggage . oo , my horoscope . taurus : `` today you will die . ''	Homer Simpson
what ? !	Marge Simpson
... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker ! lenny ?	Homer Simpson
it really says `` die '' ? that sounds unusually specific for a horoscope .	Lisa Simpson
maybe i 'd better check mine . `` today , your husband will die . '' homer , i 'm scared .	Marge Simpson
ooo , scary newspaper . do n't hurt me , horoscope . i 'm afraid of ...	Homer Simpson
ow ! oooh ! paper cut , paper cut !	Homer Simpson
missed me ! stupid horoscope !	Homer Simpson
stupid horoscope !	Homer Simpson
cloopid blore-apope !	Homer Simpson
nah , he 'll get tired of biting in an hour or so . snakes : nature 's quitters .	Homer Simpson
that horoscope was baloney . nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head , the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing . what 's for dessert ?	Homer Simpson
no dessert until you eat your broccoli .	Marge Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
but i thought broccoli was --	Marge Simpson
st. peter ! woo hoo ! got to heaven before you , flanders !	Homer Simpson
well , the thing about that is ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , i did n't get the number of hours or good deeds .	Homer Simpson
poor homie . i still ca n't believe a piece of broccoli killed you .	Marge Simpson
homer , it 's you ! ! i thought i 'd never see you again .	Marge Simpson
do you have to talk like that ?	Marge Simpson
well , i 've got a whole list of chores : clean the garage , paint the house , grout the tu --	Marge Simpson
let 's see , good deed ...	Homer Simpson
... got ta find a good deed .	Homer Simpson
bingo !	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson

hey , i thought you guys could see everything .	Homer Simpson

get it .	Homer Simpson
no , dad ! we do n't want to kill him ! let 's call animal control .	Lisa Simpson
great idea . then we should call the doctor about this .	Homer Simpson
how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt ?	Lisa Simpson
what am i , a tailor ?	Homer Simpson
area code ? but it 's a local call .	Homer Simpson
the phone company ran out of numbers , so they split the city into two area codes . half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939 .	Marge Simpson
939 ? ! what the hell is that ? oh , my life is ruined .	Homer Simpson
geez , you just have to remember three extra numbers .	Marge Simpson

i 'm not gon na stand for this . i 'm gon na call the newspapers , the tv stations , the gas stations , everybody .	Homer Simpson
i hate this new area code . like i do n't have enough to remember already .	Homer Simpson
do n't you miss the old 636 , carl ?	Homer Simpson
what really burns me up is they did n't give us one word of warning .	Homer Simpson
not a single word of warning .	Homer Simpson
joan collins ? that girl sleeps with everybody !	Homer Simpson
the who ? i love bands !	Homer Simpson
that 's my number !	Homer Simpson
hey , that 's not me !	Homer Simpson
dad , we 're not in their area code anymore .	Bart Simpson
it 's not fair ! i 've been a fan of the who since the very beginning , when they were the hillbilly bugger boys .	Homer Simpson
you should call that radio station and let 'em have it .	Bart Simpson
good idea .	Homer Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
how the hell did they find that out ?	Homer Simpson
uh , i have a question , phoney .	Homer Simpson
it 's a movie , dad .	Lisa Simpson
quiet , honey . daddy 's asking the man a question .	Homer Simpson
wait a minute ! we have n't heard from me yet . the nut with the dynamite . the phone company is bamboozling you !	Homer Simpson
i accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose !	Homer Simpson
now , i 'm not one to make trouble ... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old , or `` classic '' 636 area code , lives on ... the rich side of town !	Homer Simpson
and as usual , we joe twelve-packs get the royal screw job .	Homer Simpson
well , i 've had it ! you rich snobs are n't pushin ' us around anymore !	Homer Simpson

read my lips : yes .	Homer Simpson
dad , you got syrup on your sash .	Bart Simpson
no problem .	Homer Simpson
if you ask me ...	Lisa Simpson
stop right there .	Homer Simpson
... it 's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code . it would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight .	Lisa Simpson
sweetie , you know your mother and i only stay together for the sake of my political career .	Homer Simpson
that 's not true .	Marge Simpson
big grins !	Homer Simpson
that 'll play great in the sticks .	Homer Simpson
oh , that was fifty already ?	Homer Simpson
give it back ! that 's my novelty flying disc .	Bart Simpson
my homework is in your park .	Bart Simpson
out-of-towner tax ? !	Marge Simpson
all right , but this better be the best toilet paper i 've ever had .	Marge Simpson
ooh , why did n't you say so ? hey , is there a bathroom here ?	Marge Simpson

homer ...	Marge Simpson
it 's ringing .	Homer Simpson
and i 'd like to thank low ball construction for building this amazing wall ... from ninety percent recycled materials .	Homer Simpson
i 'm so conflicted .	Lisa Simpson
'bout what ?	Bart Simpson
loyal citizens of new springfield . you stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools , and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow . and then a wave of disease should help to -- hey !	Homer Simpson
stop streaming over the wall ! at least wait till i 'm through talking .	Homer Simpson
okay , now as for food , the following breeds of dog are edible ...	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe all those rats fled my town .	Homer Simpson
guess it 's just us and the tumbleweeds .	Homer Simpson
well , dad , you 're mayor of a ghost town .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe those traitors abandoned us . they could n't take one lousy famine .	Homer Simpson
dad , you 're bleeding .	Lisa Simpson
no problem .	Homer Simpson

but those olde springfield squares are just gon na make you cut your hair , turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like keith partridge .	Homer Simpson
somethin ' wrong with your legs ?	Homer Simpson
to be honest , it 's a little chilly .	Marge Simpson

your honor , i 'd like to be tried separately .	Homer Simpson

well , that explains the sign .	Homer Simpson
you know , we could get out of these stupid things if you 'd just tell the judge you 're a bad mother . and you do n't even have to say `` bad . '' it could be `` negligent '' or `` unfit '' or `` drugged-up . ''	Homer Simpson
i just ca n't do that , homer . it 's a matter of principle . and i need you to support me in this .	Marge Simpson
you 're right . it 's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge .	Homer Simpson

thanks for coming , mr. mccoy . we cooked your favorites : rattlejailbird meat , varmint kabobs , and refried whiskey .	Marge Simpson
take him outside .	Marge Simpson
gee buck , your old films are as violent as today 's !	Lisa Simpson
one of the wheels broke off my chair today . but i did n't make a movie about it .	Homer Simpson

for shame !	Homer Simpson
bart , i could n't help noticing buck is a total fraud . so i took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall .	Homer Simpson

well , i thought if you were looking to worship someone , maybe it could be your old man ?	Homer Simpson
eh , we could try it .	Bart Simpson
yes !	Homer Simpson
my son lost his hero . this should be the greatest night of my life . how come i 'm not happy ?	Homer Simpson
you care about bart 's feelings .	Marge Simpson

nice old man . do n't break a hip .	Homer Simpson
have we gotten all the liquor ?	Marge Simpson
mmmm , something smells delicious .	Homer Simpson
well , we 're not giving up . we 're going to cure you of drinking .	Marge Simpson
well , i do n't know . i just naturally assumed it was some of my business .	Marge Simpson
i 'm still not givin ' up on buck . there must be some hare-brained half-assed way ...	Homer Simpson
get me buck mccoy .	Homer Simpson
dad , i 'm on the line .	Lisa Simpson
here you go . just stop this bank robbery and you 'll be a hero again . i 'll wait in the car .	Homer Simpson
that hurts . but i just have one question : do you want my son to be disappointed in you ?	Homer Simpson
you do n't need that .	Homer Simpson
way to go , buck . i feel my faith growing anew .	Bart Simpson
dad !	Homer Simpson
whoa . there 's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey !	Homer Simpson

dad , i loved it , too , but it was seven years ago .	Bart Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
it was the end of the trojan war . clever odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the trojans once and for all ...	Homer Simpson

trojans .	Homer Simpson
what are you laughing at , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
if i 'm laughing at what i think i am , it 's very funny . anyway ... `` as night fell , the greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse ... ''	Homer Simpson
now , i can return to ithaca , and my sweet wife penelope .	Homer Simpson
forget it . sacrificing animals is barbaric . now have the slaves kill the wounded .	Homer Simpson
gentlemen , i must be wasted , 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me .	Homer Simpson

you are the true dauphin . you had this impostor try to fool me , to see if i was truly sent by god .	Lisa Simpson

i do n't know , but that would be hot . `` once upon a time there was a young prince of denmark . ''	Homer Simpson

flanders , what 's your secret ? you never get arrested , you do n't buy your clothes at `` mr. blob '' and look at your beautiful lawn . it sickens me .	Homer Simpson
so that 's all it takes , a little prayer .	Homer Simpson
ugh , where 's the remote ?	Homer Simpson
well , since i do n't have the remote , i can just get up and change the channel .	Homer Simpson
wait a minute . i 'll do what flanders does .	Homer Simpson

oh lord , i see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel , marge . for thou art most wise ...	Homer Simpson
you know , most people pray silently .	Marge Simpson
marge , he 's way the hell up there .	Homer Simpson

you was hiding behind the drywall . yes you were ! i 'm glad social services did n't see this . yes i am !	Homer Simpson
ooh , you coughed up some dry wall .	Homer Simpson
dad , are you hurt ?	Lisa Simpson

homer , we ca n't sue the church . they 'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin .	Marge Simpson
it would n't be the first time .	Homer Simpson
i could n't help it . those pews are so comfortable .	Homer Simpson
can i borrow your pen to sign this deposition ?	Homer Simpson
i ca n't see anything in this fog .	Homer Simpson
woo-hoo ! can i get that in lottery tickets , please ?	Homer Simpson
he 's not giving it to me , god is . because i prayed for it .	Homer Simpson
dad , i think this might be the work of satan .	Lisa Simpson
it 's all good .	Homer Simpson
homer , for the last time ...	Marge Simpson
please give the church back .	Marge Simpson
that is gon na drive me nuts .	Marge Simpson
look , this church is our only option . do n't you kids want to live here ?	Homer Simpson

i 'm sorry , ned . looks like god has packed up and left springfield .	Marge Simpson
homer , send these people home . this housewarming party 's been going on for two days .	Marge Simpson
homer are n't you afraid you might be , i do n't know , incurring god 's wrath ?	Marge Simpson
eh , god 's cool .	Homer Simpson

oh look , god 's giving us a little shower .	Homer Simpson
everybody , look at the much-needed rain . thank you , god . now turn the rainwater into wine .	Homer Simpson
oh , wet and wonderful god , your flood has driven us to the roof of your church . surely this has proven whatever point you had .	Homer Simpson
god 's ignoring me .	Homer Simpson
dad , maybe you should stop praying . see if that makes it happy .	Bart Simpson
it 's reverend lovejoy !	Marge Simpson
i guess i learned something here . god is capable of great anger and great mercy . but mostly great anger .	Homer Simpson
there are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened . the bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain . and with all the trees cut down , a flood was inevitable .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , but what made the rain stop ?	Bart Simpson
i'unno . buddha ?	Lisa Simpson

now he 's got it .	Homer Simpson
bart , the larynx is not a plaything .	Marge Simpson
mom , i am sick of the way he treats me . he disrespects me and i 'm just supposed to accept it ?	Bart Simpson
that 's right . you 're mine till you 're eighteen . and when you 're seventeen i 'm gon na know the end is near , so i 'm gon na work you like a dog .	Homer Simpson
so my dad blew all the money i made from that embarrassing commercial . promise me you wo n't tell anyone about it .	Bart Simpson
i just wish there was some way to get back at my dad .	Bart Simpson
does it make him cry ?	Bart Simpson
hmmm . badger , haggle and bill , '' `` luvum and burnham , family law , '' `` hackey , joke and dunnit . '' bingo !	Bart Simpson

mom , you 've always been cool to me . but homer is a lousy dad and i 'm not gon na take it anymore .	Bart Simpson

chief wiggum , we 're just like you policemen . do n't you ever feel like the mayor does n't care about you ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa is a nut . she has a rubber butt . every time she turns around it goes `` putt putt . ''	Bart Simpson
if we stand together , we are strong !	Lisa Simpson
but ... but i ...	Lisa Simpson

dad , you ca n't get revenge on an animal . that 's the whole point of moby dick .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , the point of moby dick is `` be yourself . ''	Homer Simpson
you 're not going , and that 's final .	Marge Simpson
fine . but do you know how ridiculous you look right now ?	Homer Simpson

every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger . yet , the imf insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules .	Homer Simpson

exactly .	Homer Simpson
gorgeous , huh ? and quite the bargain .	Homer Simpson
is n't it kind of dry ?	Marge Simpson
oh , it just needs a little love .	Homer Simpson
why do the things i love always burn ?	Homer Simpson
is n't it sufficient .	Homer Simpson
i thought we had enough money for a good tree .	Bart Simpson
homer , is there something you 're not telling us ?	Marge Simpson
what 's that ?	Marge Simpson
uh ... woo hoo ! maggie 's talking !	Homer Simpson
you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself !	Marge Simpson
there 's a trickle-down theory here . if i 'm happy , i 'm less abusive to the rest of you .	Homer Simpson
no , dad . this time you were just plain selfish .	Lisa Simpson
oh , this is sadder than `` tuesdays with morrie . ''	Homer Simpson
c'mon marge , i 'm not the only selfish person . you have to get your hair done at `` supercuts . '' i guess regular `` cuts '' just is n't good enough for you .	Homer Simpson
you just do n't get it , do you ? christmas is a time to think of others , but today you showed you only care about yourself .	Marge Simpson
that 's not true . i cared what you thought once you found out .	Homer Simpson
you can sleep on the couch tonight .	Marge Simpson
ca n't you yell at me now and get it over with ?	Homer Simpson

dad ? are you okay ?	Lisa Simpson
children , children , what day is this ?	Homer Simpson
it 's saturday , december sixth .	Lisa Simpson
thank god ! there 's still four more days 'til christmas . i have time to reform my ways !	Homer Simpson
i just saw the greatest cartoon of all time . it was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at christmas . and get this : he learns a lesson !	Homer Simpson
dad , what you saw was `` a christmas carol . '' it was written by charles dickens a hundred and sixty years ago .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , tv writers have been milkin ' that goat for years .	Bart Simpson
that last one looked kinda good .	Marge Simpson
marge , tv and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson . from now on , i will stop being selfish and start being good . in fact , i 'll be the nicest man in town .	Homer Simpson
you 've made that promise before .	Marge Simpson

good-lookin ' group .	Homer Simpson
you 're welcome !	Homer Simpson

marge , do you want this last pork chop ?	Homer Simpson
i 've dreamed of the day you 'd say that !	Marge Simpson
oh , your thoughtfulness tastes so good . and tears are the sweetest sauce .	Marge Simpson
all right , now you 're startin ' to creep me out .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not looking for glory or wealth . i 'm just buying that stairway to heaven jesus sang of .	Homer Simpson
get back to your bong , hippie .	Homer Simpson
homie , i 'm so proud -- you changed more than i could imagined ! you 're even covering your mouth when you burp .	Marge Simpson
just like the pope !	Homer Simpson
being unselfish is a natural high , like hiking or paint thinner .	Homer Simpson
and here 's another act of christian charity i pulled out of my butt .	Homer Simpson
i built a skating rink for the whole town !	Homer Simpson
here 's your skates . oh , you 'll have to take off those boots .	Homer Simpson
ewww .	Homer Simpson
pathetic flanders . thinking he can buy people 's love with thoughtful gifts .	Homer Simpson
cool . mr. flanders gave me a krusty brand operation game .	Bart Simpson
i 'll show flanders . i 'm gon na get everyone a car . what 's that one good american car ?	Homer Simpson
dad , you do n't have to out-do mr. flanders . just remember the spirit of the season .	Lisa Simpson
uh ... is it despair ?	Homer Simpson
actually , most people now feel christmas has gotten too materialistic . in fact , as a buddhist , i believe people would be a lot happier without presents .	Lisa Simpson
hmm . you 've given me a lot to think about .	Homer Simpson
people would be a lot happier without presents .	Lisa Simpson
i 've got it ... when everyone 's asleep , i 'll take away their presents . then they 'll be happy ! thanks , buddha .	Homer Simpson
you 're a hero , homer j . / you 're as crafty as a skunk / they 'll thank you in the morning for stealing flanders ' junk / homer jaaaaay ! / you 're a double-bacon genius-burger ... and just a little drunk .	Homer Simpson
now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on christmas to discover they have no presents .	Homer Simpson
they do n't sound happy ... but here comes a mob , shaking their fists in gratitude .	Homer Simpson
um , should n't you all be singing carols or something ?	Homer Simpson
wait a minute , everyone ! there 's your christmas up there !	Homer Simpson
let 's just say that on this day , a million years ago , a dude was born who most of us think was magic , but others do n't , and that 's cool . but we 're probably right . amen .	Homer Simpson
and now , i think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts ! ned ?	Homer Simpson
what a great christmas . not even moe 's annual suicide attempt can ruin it .	Bart Simpson
hey ! i 'm watchin ' that !	Bart Simpson
not any more .	Lisa Simpson
i missed the feeding frenzy . i hope you 're happy .	Bart Simpson
obviously , yes .	Lisa Simpson
look , maggie . a show for babies .	Marge Simpson
mom , that 's roofi . his music is why babies are idiots .	Bart Simpson
well , maggie likes roofi . and babies only like good things .	Marge Simpson

whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop ! whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop , whoop !	Homer Simpson
whatever .	Marge Simpson
this concert is oversold . it 's as if a music promoter acted unscrupulously !	Marge Simpson
they make the blue man group look like mummenschanz , which is still pretty good . oh . the second one wants custard , too . that 's a little repetitive .	Marge Simpson
oh no , it 's raining ! and maggie 's diapers are extra-absorbent !	Marge Simpson
excuse me , everyone . i 'm a mother .	Marge Simpson
and i 'm an american !	Marge Simpson
i bake apple pies !	Marge Simpson
and i love baseball !	Marge Simpson
you ca n't change the rules in the middle of the game ! we never would have had these kids if we 'd thought we had to pay for 'em . promises were made !	Homer Simpson
then how would we ever get to see `` camelot '' ?	Marge Simpson
is that better ? to me , ralph wiggum is sir lancelot .	Marge Simpson
ms. naegle , i 'm sorry to surprise you like this , but i thought if we met face-to-face , we could settle our differences .	Marge Simpson
i 'll cut to the chase . i brought with me the very best reason i can think of for what i believe in .	Marge Simpson
her name is lisa . and i would n't trade her for all the sleep-in sundays and speed dating in the world .	Marge Simpson
ms. naegle , even though i disagree with your principles , i certainly admire your success .	Lisa Simpson
mom , i locked your keys in the car .	Bart Simpson
then wait in the shadows !	Marge Simpson
also , maggie puked in your purse again .	Bart Simpson
then , i guess this means war . with the most powerful weapon at my disposal : a voter-sponsored initiative .	Marge Simpson
i 've already drawn up the petition .	Marge Simpson
no , the march primary .	Marge Simpson
mom , can we get a pretzel ?	Bart Simpson
we 've got pretzels at home .	Marge Simpson
not cinnamon .	Bart Simpson
attention , everyone .	Marge Simpson
i wish to announce the formation of ppassccatag : proud parents against singles seniors childless couples and teens and gays .	Marge Simpson
to overturn these horrible anti-family laws , we 've prepared the `` families come first '' initiative . now , the first thing we 're gon na need is money .	Marge Simpson
save our families ! sign our petition !	Marge Simpson
but i have n't endorsed it yet !	Marge Simpson
forget it .	Marge Simpson
i guess no one gives a damn about the american family anymore .	Marge Simpson
mr. burns ? you care about children ?	Marge Simpson
that ad makes me look like a criminal .	Marge Simpson
then why did you appear in it ?	Homer Simpson
that was n't me !	Marge Simpson
maybe she was you and you 're not ! how many kids do we have ?	Homer Simpson
three !	Marge Simpson

what are you going to do ?	Marge Simpson
you just leave everything to homer . and now , i believe you owe me half a sandwich .	Homer Simpson
i always keep one near the bed for you .	Marge Simpson
here comes my commercial . in six , five , four ...	Homer Simpson
i probably should have watched it first .	Marge Simpson
you 've probably heard a lot of bad things about families come first .	Homer Simpson
but newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks . who really opposes `` families come first ? ''	Homer Simpson
many childless advocates are like ben affleck -- famous , successful people from out of state !	Homer Simpson
they live in fancy houses in other places .	Homer Simpson
`` families come first '' is supported by lifelong springfieldians you know and trust like me , milhouse 's dad , bumblebee man , surly duff , and that jerk that goes `` yeees ! ''	Homer Simpson

that 's what we in the business call `` a biggie . ''	Homer Simpson

i guess i 'm not meant to own a cat . i 'm much happier petting this leaf .	Lisa Simpson

he was my best friend .	Homer Simpson
cool , an ambulance from the '60s ! i bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing . injured hippies !	Homer Simpson
i 'll do it !	Homer Simpson
guess what ? i quit my job as a used car salesman .	Homer Simpson
you work at the nuclear plant .	Marge Simpson
get with the program , marge . your husband is now an ambulance driver !	Homer Simpson
do n't you need training for that ?	Lisa Simpson
maybe on planet zoozoo .	Homer Simpson
hey , i think it 's cool . i can defibrillate lisa !	Bart Simpson
not if i pump your heart full of morphine first !	Lisa Simpson
kids , kids . those are n't your toys . they 're to keep daddy asleep and awake .	Homer Simpson
i 'm gon na need them on my first shift tonight .	Homer Simpson
tonight ? but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel .	Marge Simpson
slow down , picasso ! you were gon na start a novel without informing me ?	Homer Simpson
homer , you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call .	Marge Simpson
i also fed some ducklings .	Homer Simpson

i 'm writing a novel !	Marge Simpson
whatever . but i think you look great already .	Homer Simpson
thank you !	Marge Simpson
hmm ... what should i write about ?	Marge Simpson
that painting has always sparked my imagination .	Marge Simpson
that 's it . a novel about whaling -- that 's something you have n't seen before . thank you ...	Marge Simpson
scene from moby-dick .	Marge Simpson
`` chapter one : starts and beginnings . '' `` swim , swim , swim , thought the whale , flapping his ... floppers . '' brownie break !	Marge Simpson
`` ... mayor quimby , disco stu , and our fighting men and women overseas . '' well , i finished the `` thank yous , '' time to go back to the novel .	Marge Simpson
temperance barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham ...	Marge Simpson

hospital , eh ? wow , everyone 's goin ' there tonight .	Homer Simpson
dad , you 've been driving in circles for twenty minutes .	Bart Simpson
why do n't you just admit you do n't know where the hospital is ?	Lisa Simpson
why do n't you admit i know it 's around here somewhere ?	Homer Simpson
for temperance , the days passed on ... as did seven of her ten children .	Marge Simpson
marge , i 'm back !	Homer Simpson

fine . right after this revision !	Marge Simpson
temperance had to face the unhappy truth ...	Marge Simpson
... she had married a brute .	Marge Simpson
this story is as dark as those new milky way bars . ooh , that 's a good analogy . i 'll work it in somewhere . but now i need some romance , pronto !	Marge Simpson
ned , that 's so considerate .	Marge Simpson
boy , when you write you can let your imagination run wild . `` temperance was doing the laundry ... ''	Marge Simpson
what do you know ? it is !	Marge Simpson
i 'm finished ! and it 's so suggestive . but like they say , `` snuggling sells . '' now , do i dare push `` print ? ''	Marge Simpson
well , what do you think ?	Marge Simpson
hm ...	Lisa Simpson
i 'm proud of you , mom . but just one thing : is n't your book a little hard on dad ?	Lisa Simpson
what do you mean ? my book is set in whaling times .	Marge Simpson
`` captain mordecai stared at the shop window full of powdered blowholes . 'mmm , blowholes , ' he drooled . '' sounds like dad to me .	Lisa Simpson
well , i guess that part is loosely based on your father .	Marge Simpson
maybe you should let dad read your book before you submit it to publishers .	Lisa Simpson
i suppose i better . your father 's a very private person .	Marge Simpson
marge ! we 're out of bath towels .	Homer Simpson
ooh , ice cream truck !	Homer Simpson
here in my car / i am hosing off blood / some of it 's mine / but most of it 's not / here 's marge ...	Homer Simpson
homie , i finished my novel .	Marge Simpson

it 's really important that you read it and tell me what you think .	Marge Simpson
no problem .	Homer Simpson
two hundred and eighty-six pages !	Homer Simpson
it 's double-spaced .	Marge Simpson
woo hoo ! i 'm half-way through !	Homer Simpson

no ! got ta read marge 's book . ca n't get distracted . hm ... `` distracted , '' that 's a funny word . does anyone ever get `` tracted ? '' let me call the suicide hotline and ask them .	Homer Simpson
well ?	Marge Simpson
well what ?	Homer Simpson
did you read the book ?	Marge Simpson
oh , yes .	Homer Simpson
did you like it ?	Marge Simpson

oh that 's wonderful . and the characters did n't bother you at all ?	Marge Simpson
no ! they were all in their own way totally awesome .	Homer Simpson
and you 're fine with me trying to get it published ?	Marge Simpson
as i 've always said : `` publish or perish '' !	Homer Simpson
oh homie !	Marge Simpson
hello ?	Marge Simpson
if dad ever reads that book , he 's gon na be so humiliated .	Lisa Simpson
he 'll never read it .	Bart Simpson
what if they make it into a movie ?	Lisa Simpson
he 'll never see it .	Bart Simpson
what if they parody it on mad tv ?	Lisa Simpson
we 're doomed .	Bart Simpson
so , how much bleach did you drink ? not a talker , eh ?	Homer Simpson
dr. marvin monroe ? ! i have n't seen you in years .	Marge Simpson
apu , do you sell crazy straws ? i 've got a guy with a broken back and i 'm tryin ' to cheer him up .	Homer Simpson
what are you talking about ?	Homer Simpson
why do you keep talking that way ? !	Homer Simpson
well , then maybe i will .	Homer Simpson
that one i got .	Homer Simpson
i 'll have to read marge 's book . and i swore never to read again after `` to kill a mockingbird '' gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds . it did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin , but what good does that do me ?	Homer Simpson
the harpooned heart . book on tape ! as read by mary-kate and ashley olsen .	Homer Simpson
the harpooned heart ii : thunder down under . chapter one . temperance barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie ...	Marge Simpson
how can you write such horrible things about me ?	Homer Simpson
you told me you liked it ! you did n't read it at all ! you lied to me !	Marge Simpson
i did n't lie . i was writing fiction with my mouth .	Homer Simpson
just tell me how much of this is true !	Homer Simpson
well ... there is a place called nantucket .	Marge Simpson
i knew it ! and what about the romance between you and cyrus ?	Homer Simpson
it was only my imagination .	Marge Simpson
well , i 'll make sure you never imagine anything again .	Homer Simpson
flanders !	Homer Simpson
open this door right now !	Homer Simpson
what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
dad 's gon na catch flanders , just like the end of mom 's book .	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah . how does that go again ?	Bart Simpson
did n't you read mom 's book ?	Lisa Simpson
fine , i 'll tell you how it ends . the brutish captain mordecai has cornered his rival , cyrus ...	Lisa Simpson
`` as temperance watched the two men she had loved and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean , she realized it was ... the end . ''	Marge Simpson
flanders , pull over ! i 'm an ambulance !	Homer Simpson
flanders , i 'm gon na do something i shoulda done a long time ago .	Homer Simpson
would you help me be a better husband ?	Homer Simpson
in marge 's book i was so mean and you were so nice . how can i be more like you ? just give me some advice .	Homer Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
please homie , do n't hurt him !	Marge Simpson
why would i rub her back unless i wanted to get some ... oh , to make her feel good .	Homer Simpson
oh , homie ! you 're trying to improve yourself , and it 's because of my book .	Marge Simpson
that 's right . i love you marge , and i realize now i should show you more often . the end of your book was the wakeup call i needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book .	Homer Simpson
that 's the best review i 've gotten . seriously . these reviews are terrible .	Marge Simpson
do n't worry about those losers , marge . i think it 's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own .	Homer Simpson
marge , i 've got it all figured out : lee harvey oswald wanted to steal the jack ruby .	Homer Simpson
jack ruby was a man , not a jewel .	Marge Simpson
all right , we 're back to square one . put on some coffee .	Homer Simpson
i was so close .	Homer Simpson
i have to research a paper . where did all the books go ?	Lisa Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
`` everybody poops , the video ? '' `` yu-gi-oh price guides ? '' there are hardly any books at all !	Lisa Simpson
there , there , i can help you kids .	Marge Simpson
i know a little something about history . gather 'round .	Marge Simpson
henry the eighth had everything he could want , except a son to follow in his footsteps ...	Marge Simpson
i ca n't .	Lisa Simpson
why ca n't your heir be female ? or-or why ca n't we elect our leaders ?	Lisa Simpson
leaving !	Lisa Simpson
finally , henry 's daughter elizabeth became queen . england 's power was never greater , and british actresses always had a role to play when they got to a certain age .	Marge Simpson
mom , i ca n't find anything on sacagawea . just a couple books on ron santo .	Lisa Simpson
no problem ! in elementary school , we girls learned about sacagawea while the boys were learning math !	Marge Simpson
okay .	Lisa Simpson
in 1804 , president jefferson ...	Marge Simpson
... sent lewis and clark and some embedded journalists to find the northwest passage .	Marge Simpson
they paddled up the mississippi from st. louis ...	Marge Simpson
when winter came , lewis and clark tried to set up camp , but encountered much hardship .	Marge Simpson
come spring , they sought help from the native americans .	Marge Simpson
oh c'mon . ca n't we at least have one pity scalp ?	Bart Simpson
and today , lewis ' promise has been fulfilled .	Marge Simpson
what is that , a quarter ?	Bart Simpson
no , it 's a sacagawea dollar . you can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar ! eh ?	Marge Simpson
bart , what famous historical figure do you want to write about ?	Marge Simpson
i'unno . the boogeyman ?	Bart Simpson
c'mon , bart -- we can make this fun . history 's like an amusement park , except instead of rides , you have dates to memorize .	Marge Simpson
mom , everyone who ever lived is boring .	Bart Simpson
boring ? is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young ?	Marge Simpson
i know there 's a catch , but tell me more .	Bart Simpson
as a young prodigy , this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century europe ...	Marge Simpson
oh , i ca n't stand it .	Lisa Simpson
and that 's the life of mozart . thank god he died young . i 've got ta get dinner on the stove .	Marge Simpson
mom , that sounds a lot like the movie `` amadeus , '' which was historically inaccurate . mozart worked hard on his music ... salieri was a respected composer ...	Lisa Simpson
all i know is the guy who played mozart was also in `` animal house . '' now there 's a movie with good music . animal house house house ... / nobody ever went to class ... / then we saw donald sutherland 's ass ... / animal house house house ... /	Homer Simpson
hey , that was n't me , that was milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
rollin ' , rollin ' , rollin ' / toxic barrel rollin '	Homer Simpson

well , i think we all learned a lesson today : do n't try to be something you 're not . namely , food .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry i ran off . being second to maggie 's not so bad . but why did n't maggie press the right button 'til i told her to ?	Lisa Simpson
how 'd you get in here ?	Homer Simpson

not for babies .	Lisa Simpson
the wild dingleberries ?	Homer Simpson

honey , can daddy rest his soda on your head ?	Homer Simpson
that 's my girl .	Homer Simpson
you took little children to `` the re-deadening '' ? !	Marge Simpson
homer , this is a rare lapse in judgment for you .	Marge Simpson
but scaring kids is good for them . it hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams .	Homer Simpson
sorry . i forgot i bought the soundtrack album .	Homer Simpson
honey , i know you 're scared . but there 's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there .	Marge Simpson
oh , your nightlight 's burned out . and the only bulbs we have left are these red ones .	Marge Simpson

daddy 's not on fire .	Marge Simpson

marge ? are you helping her ?	Homer Simpson
i wo n't let edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact , whittling away the batteries until they die .	Marge Simpson

comic book guy made me pay for these comics he said i smudged . but i did n't even touch 'em !	Bart Simpson
`` richie rich incorporates in delaware , '' `` easy to believe tales , '' `` supergirl vs. the glass ceiling , '' `` the green listener '' ...	Lisa Simpson
he was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid .	Bart Simpson
somebody ought to take him down a peg . or , should i say , down a pie .	Homer Simpson
no , i think the expression is `` peg . ''	Lisa Simpson
maybe you 're right , lisa . maybe you 're pie . pie-be you 're pie .	Homer Simpson
comic book guy ! do n't do the crime if you ca n't do the key lime !	Homer Simpson
there 's a note ! `` evildoers beware ! signed , simple simon , your friendly neighborhood pie man . ''	Bart Simpson
you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he 's very good looking .	Marge Simpson
oh , i think you 'd find his filling extremely hot .	Homer Simpson
ooh , i 'll bet he 's ned flanders .	Marge Simpson
flanders ! ? he 's not man enough to trim my crust . i mean pie man 's crust . i 'm not pie man .	Homer Simpson
this is for your show 's slight decline in quality over the years !	Homer Simpson
not so fast , old-time liberal .	Homer Simpson
no trap can hold homer simpson ! but i 'm not homer simpson . i 'm the pie man . homer simpson away ! i mean , the pie man !	Homer Simpson
dammit !	Homer Simpson
i 'm not being trampled . what gives ?	Marge Simpson
listen ... i 'm married .	Marge Simpson
i 'm looking up your nose , but i feel like i 'm staring into your soul .	Marge Simpson
that was so exciting , yet familiar . like coke with lemon .	Marge Simpson
let 's see ... cartilage , cartilage , muscle , nerve ! ... artery ... bullet .	Homer Simpson
dad ?	Lisa Simpson
pie man is not your father , little girl . i ... murdered your father .	Homer Simpson
dad , please . it 's obvious you 're pie man . we 've been getting his mail for weeks .	Lisa Simpson
we shall continue this conversation in the pie cave .	Homer Simpson
watch it , one more step . welcome to my secret lair .	Homer Simpson
dad , this is the basement . here 's the iced tea i left down here this afternoon .	Lisa Simpson
so it would seem . anyhoo , i 'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise , huh ? mild-mannered homer simpson ...	Homer Simpson
you 're not mild-mannered . you 're often liquored-up and rude .	Lisa Simpson
honorable men can differ . now what brings you down here ?	Homer Simpson
i want you to stop this , dad . before you get killed .	Lisa Simpson
all right , i 'll stop . but what 'll i do with these pies ?	Homer Simpson
well , i know one thing you could do ...	Lisa Simpson
i was in so deep , i forgot pies were food .	Homer Simpson
i 'll show him .	Homer Simpson
no , i should n't .	Homer Simpson
or should i ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll keep my promise , honey .	Homer Simpson
since when do i listen to cakes ?	Homer Simpson
you 're all so wise ... i wish i could eat each and every one of you .	Homer Simpson
i 've run out of pie-related puns !	Homer Simpson
it 's not a rubber band , it 's a scrunchie !	Homer Simpson
i already work for you .	Homer Simpson
do i get two paychecks ?	Homer Simpson
but i promised my daughter --	Homer Simpson
nooo ! not community service -- i ca n't stand helping others ! i just ca n't !	Homer Simpson
no , not him ! anyone but him ! i 've had my problems with him . everyone has . but like every monster , he just wants to be loved .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't sleep . i keep thinking about the pie man .	Homer Simpson
oh , me too ...	Marge Simpson
what if he started pieing good people ? not because he wanted to , but because he was being blackmailed by his boss ?	Homer Simpson
homie ... are you the pie man ?	Marge Simpson
no , i 'm not . and here 's a picture that proves it .	Homer Simpson
see ...	Homer Simpson
well , whoever he is , the pie man would never cave in to blackmail .	Marge Simpson
now , on a different subject , kiss me hard .	Marge Simpson
you know i 'm not pie man .	Homer Simpson
i do n't care .	Marge Simpson
oh come on , she 's a little girl .	Homer Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson
the dalai lama !	Homer Simpson
as springfield 's youngest buddhist , i am deeply honored to introduce the dalai lama .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't do this in front of lisa . why does she have to believe in things ?	Homer Simpson
and now please welcome the elvis of enlightenment ... the lean , serene , chanting machine : the dalai lama !	Lisa Simpson
please forgive me , talking llama .	Homer Simpson
no , pie man ! do n't do it !	Lisa Simpson
c'mon , pie man , hit him ! that 's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing !	Bart Simpson
no . i wo n't . there 's only one way i can escape from this nightmare .	Homer Simpson
i 'm telling you , i 'm the pie man !	Homer Simpson
dad , i think you created a hero that even you could n't live up to .	Lisa Simpson
yeah . let 's go home , honey .	Homer Simpson
i know one person who believes you were the pie man , homie ... me . i 've known it all along .	Marge Simpson
was it the kiss ?	Homer Simpson
no , it was clearly you in that suit . you 'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start .	Marge Simpson
so ... pie man , why do n't you show me your superpowers ? pie man ?	Marge Simpson
wherever injustice shows its ugly face , i will be there ! for i am the pie man !	Homer Simpson
and wherever pie man is , the cupcake kid will not be far behind .	Bart Simpson
while you two are up on the roof , why do n't you take the leaves out of the gutter !	Marge Simpson
because i 'm `` it . ''	Bart Simpson
now , whoever finishes first gets a lemonade ...	Bart Simpson
... for me .	Bart Simpson
uh-oh . girls . you guys need your cootie shots .	Bart Simpson
okay , ladies . do n't you have a poodle to dress up ?	Bart Simpson
i would n't mind pushin ' that in the mud .	Bart Simpson
homer drunk ... but how ? hmmm ...	Homer Simpson
eww ! i kissed that sad , weird kid !	Homer Simpson
my beer ! you never had a chance to become my urine ! why you little ...	Homer Simpson
stop it , homer ! there 's only one way to settle this -- in simpson family court .	Marge Simpson
what the hell 's that ?	Bart Simpson
i got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children .	Marge Simpson
now up , the case of simpson v. simpson .	Lisa Simpson
mr. simpson , do you think it 's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss ?	Homer Simpson
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son 's little league team ?	Bart Simpson
permission to treat this witness as hostile .	Homer Simpson
homer , i 'll bet when you were ten you were stealing beers , kissin ' girls and tippin ' dinosaurs .	Bart Simpson
your father 's first kiss was in high school -- with me .	Marge Simpson
actually , marge ... uh ... there uh , was someone before you .	Homer Simpson
it was years ago , when i was ten . back in the '60s , or '50s , or maybe it was the early '70s ...	Homer Simpson
i thought we were gon na play fun games at camp .	Homer Simpson
i could n't believe my eye .	Homer Simpson
she was the prettiest girl i 'd ever seen . uh ... until i met your mother , who made that girl look like a godzilla made of garbage .	Homer Simpson
homer , that girl was me !	Marge Simpson
how romantic . you and dad were drawn to each other as kids and you did n't even realize it .	Lisa Simpson
yes ... and then your father broke my heart . and if i 'd known he was you , i never would have married you !	Marge Simpson
oh , this is so confusing . i 'd like a brief recess .	Homer Simpson
granted .	Lisa Simpson
whee ! recess !	Homer Simpson
let me get this straight . when you were my age , you had the hots for mom and did n't even know it ? that 's cool . or is it lame ? i guess i 'll go with lame . you 're lame .	Bart Simpson
why ? because i only kissed one girl in my whole life ? that 's still one more than you .	Homer Simpson
i 've kissed three girls .	Bart Simpson
i 'm so lame !	Homer Simpson
you 're not gon na be kissing anybody for a while .	Marge Simpson
well , that stinks . but i still get to kiss you , right ?	Homer Simpson
mom , why are you so mad ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'll start from the beginning . the girls ' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment . now that i 've captured your interest , let me continue ...	Marge Simpson
i used to walk like this all the time ... until my tendon snapped . they heard it in shelbyville !	Marge Simpson
anyhoo ... one night we had a special dinner .	Marge Simpson
we were learning to use all thirty-three forks .	Marge Simpson
think , homer , think .	Homer Simpson
i 'm elvis . elvis jagger . elvis jagger abdul-jabbar .	Homer Simpson
i told my friends i had a date ...	Marge Simpson
leslie who ?	Bart Simpson
uggams !	Marge Simpson
we 've heard the same story two times now . whose side are we gon na hear next ? the sea captain 's ?	Bart Simpson
there goes a good friend .	Homer Simpson
now , i 'm gon na warn you kids : the next part of the story gets a little `` w-b '' ...	Marge Simpson
way to go , dad !	Bart Simpson
the perfect kiss !	Lisa Simpson
it was pretty delicious .	Homer Simpson
it was as satisfying as a million hallmark cards with all the right-sized envelopes .	Marge Simpson
it felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies .	Homer Simpson
but then your father showed his true colors .	Marge Simpson
whuh-oh .	Homer Simpson
so we arranged to meet again at `` second date rock . ''	Marge Simpson
it was years before i could trust a boy again .	Marge Simpson
that 's horrible . how could you , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't believe you stood mom up .	Lisa Simpson
face it , lis -- men are dogs . the worse we treat you , the more you want us .	Bart Simpson
that 's not what dogs do .	Lisa Simpson
ha ha ! you said `` dog doo '' !	Bart Simpson
she sure did . now if lisa is finished with her shenanigans , i 'll tell you why i did n't show up ...	Homer Simpson
we had just finished our first smooch . and i felt a feeling i 'd never felt before :	Homer Simpson
kids love trains .	Homer Simpson
hey , have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl ?	Homer Simpson
she would n't do that -- we shared something special .	Homer Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
i just blew my first chance at true love .	Homer Simpson
and now that my special girl has heard the truth , i know she 'll forgive me .	Homer Simpson
earth to special girl ? you forgive me , right ?	Homer Simpson
i guess so .	Marge Simpson
uh , i think we 'll go to bed now .	Lisa Simpson
what are you doing ? if they fight in front of us , we might get new bikes !	Bart Simpson
homer , when you nurse a hurt for thirty years , it does n't go away in an instant .	Marge Simpson
what about now ?	Homer Simpson
what about now ?	Homer Simpson
no , homer .	Marge Simpson
what about now ?	Homer Simpson
no , homer .	Marge Simpson
what about now ?	Homer Simpson
no , homer .	Marge Simpson
marge , i 'm really sorry i hurt you . but i 've done way worse stuff since then : there was the gun i hid from you , the time i sued the church , ruining lisa 's wedding in the future ... remember that ?	Homer Simpson
homie , i know this should n't bother me , but a girl only has one first love . i guess it did n't mean that much to you .	Marge Simpson
that 's not true ! i thought about that girl every day of my life ... until i met you .	Homer Simpson
i wish there was some way i could believe that .	Marge Simpson
all right . this is my memory box . i have n't opened it in thirty years .	Homer Simpson
ooh , a letter from my old pen pal . someday i 'll write you back , osama . ah , here 's what i 'm lookin ' for .	Homer Simpson
oh , homie ! you did care .	Marge Simpson
i sure did . i kept it right next to my ibm stock ... king .	Homer Simpson
i kept my heart too .	Marge Simpson
because somehow you realized i was a good guy after all ?	Homer Simpson
no , as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do .	Marge Simpson
but now it can have a second meaning .	Marge Simpson
oh , elvis .	Marge Simpson
oh , anonymous girl who turned out to be marge .	Homer Simpson
how 's the ice cream , kids ?	Marge Simpson
great !	Lisa Simpson
who 's ready for a kitten ?	Marge Simpson
i am !	Bart Simpson
make mine calico !	Lisa Simpson
here you go .	Homer Simpson
this whole morning has been wonderful . too wonderful .	Lisa Simpson
you 're right , this is it . they 're selling us to be crash test dummies .	Bart Simpson
oh , please let it be volvo .	Lisa Simpson
oh , you children are too suspicious . it 's go time .	Marge Simpson
it 's shot day !	Bart Simpson
karatã© !	Bart Simpson
bart ! that hobo skeleton is not a toy !	Marge Simpson
this is ridiculous . only babies and ex-junkies are afraid of needles . stick me , chuckles !	Lisa Simpson

no thanks . i already helped myself .	Bart Simpson
see ya later , inoculator !	Bart Simpson
do n't feel bad , doc . i wo n't even let my mom clip my toenails .	Bart Simpson

whoa , something 's wrong ! ah , ah , i ca n't hear !	Bart Simpson
doctor ! perform a diagnosis !	Homer Simpson

oh , homer , stop it !	Homer Simpson
even my best friends have left me ! i 'm all alone !	Homer Simpson
we 've become pariahs ! in the last two hours i 've gotten one thousand hate spams .	Lisa Simpson
y'ello . appear on your tv show ? ! tell our side of the story ? ! you 'll see us there ? ! goodbye ? ! dial tone ? !	Homer Simpson
if there 's one way to get the truth out , it 's on a cable news channel .	Marge Simpson
when we explain our side of the story , the hate calls will end . i wo n't have to hear `` suck my such and such '' or `` hell this '' and `` bitch that ... ''	Marge Simpson
we get it , mom .	Lisa Simpson
no , no , no , let her finish .	Homer Simpson
look , what should i say to make people not hate me ?	Bart Simpson
son , i 've learned one thing in this life : to stay out of trouble , just say nothing . do n't rock the boat . do n't even get in the boat .	Homer Simpson
just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier . but do n't go in the bathrooms , they 're filthy .	Homer Simpson
dad , i am going on a talk show . i have to say something !	Bart Simpson
talk about boats ! then when he asks you if you hate this country , you just start crying and pretend you do n't .	Homer Simpson
but i do n't hate this country .	Bart Simpson
there there , save your lies for the american public .	Homer Simpson
nash , i 've realized something . i 'm the worst kid in the world , and the last thing i deserve is forgiveness . but with a little help from jesus and our fighting men and women overseas --	Bart Simpson
well , america 's not perfect --	Marge Simpson
if by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts , which everyone seems to be in this country , then yes , i do hate americans !	Marge Simpson
what 'd you say ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll have you know i am very well liked in springfield .	Marge Simpson
i 'm as patriotic as the next person , but changing the traffic lights to red , white and blue just seems dangerous .	Lisa Simpson
homeland noodles with uncle sam balls ? apu , are n't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism ?	Marge Simpson
uh oh . poonam and uma are fighting !	Marge Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
i 'd like to say something about the current climate of repression and fear .	Lisa Simpson
`` congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . ''	Lisa Simpson
that 's from the first amendment to the constitution . thank you .	Lisa Simpson
buy me some peanuts and crackerjack ... / i do n't care if ... ow !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe they put us in jail .	Marge Simpson
it 's not a jail , it 's a `` reeducation center . ''	Lisa Simpson
well , where do you think we are ?	Bart Simpson
well , let 's see , after they blindfolded us , it was left , right , left ... then a three hour plane ride .	Marge Simpson
do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates ?	Homer Simpson
you were right , homie . we should n't have rocked the boat . then none of this would have ever happened .	Marge Simpson
well , we 're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned . check out all the left-wing celebrities .	Lisa Simpson
bill clinton ? what are you doin ' here ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones .	Marge Simpson
lisa , that 's not funny . you believe in the bill of rights .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know whether it 's the lack of sleep , the sodium pentathol , or that it 's the only cartoon i 've seen in two months . but this is what i believe in now .	Lisa Simpson
homer , we 've got to get outta here .	Marge Simpson
yeah , yeah . next commercial .	Homer Simpson

o beautiful / for spacious skies / for amber waves of grain ...	Lisa Simpson
fifty stars and thirteen stripes ...	Homer Simpson

to love our country is no chore ...	Homer Simpson
wait right here for our encore ...	Marge Simpson
we mean it , do n't move .	Homer Simpson
okay , kids show off your pipes ...	Homer Simpson
dad , why are you still singing that stupid song ?	Bart Simpson
because if they catch us , we may have to do it again . and this time i want it tight !	Homer Simpson

maman , please pass ze baguette .	Lisa Simpson
the food is so delicious here . and these chanel suits are five for a dollar ! i 'm using a jacket as a napkin .	Marge Simpson
and here no one calls me a fat jerk ... i 'm a gourmand !	Homer Simpson
and yet , i miss america .	Marge Simpson
i miss america , too . the united states has its grandeur and its follies , but mostly it 's the place where all our stuff is .	Lisa Simpson
i wish we could go back , but i do n't think we 're welcome there .	Marge Simpson
no , marge , there 's one group that 's always welcome in america : immigrants without i.d .	Homer Simpson
well , kids , this is the first chapter of our brand new lives ... in america .	Homer Simpson
simpson .	Homer Simpson
ooh , that 'll save some time .	Homer Simpson
now , kids , it 'll take us a while to assimilate . i 'll start out as a cop , and then , with time , become a dirty cop .	Homer Simpson
i think i 'm going to like this `` america . ''	Marge Simpson
bart ! you promised you 'd stop making that comparison .	Homer Simpson
per ... our ... agreement !	Homer Simpson
gee , i never noticed that before .	Lisa Simpson
he 's got a tree in his eye !	Lisa Simpson
if that tree gets too big , it 'll ruin the beauty of that rock . we 'll lose tourists ! and then who will buy my roadside corn ?	Homer Simpson
you do n't sell roadside corn .	Marge Simpson
there 's a lot you do n't know about me , marge . a lot that would shock you .	Homer Simpson

you 're not the boss of me .	Homer Simpson
hmmm .	Lisa Simpson
please spare me . i 'm not a murderer , i 'm not . and i 've never known the pleasures of a woman ... or a proper eating apple !	Homer Simpson
shrink ray ? oh , there 's always something else to buy .	Homer Simpson
that sounds like maggie . but she 's right here ...	Marge Simpson
hold on , maggie ! daddy 's coming !	Homer Simpson
i 've got her !	Homer Simpson

dad , you should listen to him . he 's a man of science and you can barely read !	Lisa Simpson
bah ! has science ever kissed a woman , or won the super bowl , or put a man on the moon ? this is what i think of your precious science .	Homer Simpson
help me , science !	Homer Simpson
why is my swimsuit so revealing ?	Marge Simpson
marge , that 's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage .	Homer Simpson
maybe this 'll help .	Homer Simpson
where 'd you get that rib ?	Marge Simpson
there 's a whole rack of 'em over there . i only ate two .	Homer Simpson
bart , what are you doing ?	Marge Simpson
takin ' a whiz .	Bart Simpson
stop that ! we 're guests in mr. burns !	Marge Simpson
to get maggie in time , we 'll have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the body 's information super-highway !	Lisa Simpson
learning is cool !	Bart Simpson
and to make sure we get there super fast , i 'm hitting all the buttons with my palm .	Homer Simpson
oh my sweet , undigested baby !	Marge Simpson
oh , my god ! this is the worst halloween horror we 've ever faced .	Lisa Simpson
and white blood cells are attacking my clothes !	Marge Simpson
although i must admit , they know where to stop .	Marge Simpson
we 'll have to lighten the ship , which means one of us has to stay behind . bart ? ... lisa ? ...	Homer Simpson
fine , me .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry . we 'll be fine !	Marge Simpson
i 'm saying goodbye to everything i ever loved . ooh , a marshmallow !	Homer Simpson
boy , when god closes a door , he opens a window .	Homer Simpson
mom , did you have to fly out through all those boogers ?	Bart Simpson
cut me some slack , i 'm a widow .	Marge Simpson
dad , would you like some of my snicker-bar cheesecake ?	Lisa Simpson
i say when we 're full . you do n't wan na piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside .	Homer Simpson
i need a mouth hole . and some other holes too .	Homer Simpson
i 've got you deep in the heart of me ...	Homer Simpson
you know , black dracula is now a congressman from virginia .	Homer Simpson
bart , where did you get those ?	Marge Simpson
there 's an open house next door . they 're giving out cookies and business cards !	Bart Simpson
check it out , i 'm a business jerk !	Bart Simpson
simpson .	Marge Simpson
marge , i do n't want to buy this house . i 'd have to live next door to myself .	Homer Simpson
turn that down !	Homer Simpson
relax , we 're just looky-loos . we 're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors .	Marge Simpson
oh c'mon , marge . it 's not fair to compare us to an american household .	Homer Simpson
it 's so beautiful and modern . ooh , a sub-zero fridge ...	Marge Simpson
a slightly colder fridge ? in my lifetime ? amazing .	Homer Simpson
this is the kitchen i 've always wanted . ooh , a bread maker-maker !	Marge Simpson
and check this out .	Homer Simpson
a walk-in microwave ! hey marge , can you press stop when my popcorn 's done ?	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
homie , when i married you , i knew we would n't live in luxury .	Marge Simpson
and i kept that vow .	Homer Simpson
but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves .	Marge Simpson
i 'll build you a new kitchen , sweetie .	Homer Simpson
oh , homie ... that 's so thoughtful , but maybe we should hire a professional contractor .	Marge Simpson
a contractor ? those guys are the biggest crooks around . they charge for materials and labor ! pick one , jerks !	Homer Simpson
man , that hurt . and now to do the exact same thing again .	Homer Simpson
maybe you should turn off the power .	Marge Simpson
all right .	Homer Simpson
do n't demolish along the way !	Marge Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
easy ... easy ...	Homer Simpson
playdude magazines ? have you been hiding bosom rags from me ?	Marge Simpson
trying to .	Homer Simpson
these magazines are from before we were married . maybe you should throw them away .	Marge Simpson
but i need them for the articles !	Homer Simpson
the articles , eh ? so you would n't mind if i cut out all the erotic nudes ?	Marge Simpson
of course not . why would i want to look at a nude woman i 'm not even married to ? i mean , i would n't even know how she could improve me .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not wearing any clothes . so why do n't i just splay myself on a pool table !	Marge Simpson
steady , steady ...	Homer Simpson
okay , here 's your precious articles .	Marge Simpson
thanks , marge . i ca n't wait to read about `` sport fishing with sonny jurgensen . ''	Homer Simpson
what man would want you now ?	Homer Simpson
whoa -- playdudes !	Bart Simpson
i got ta be honest -- i do n't see what all the hubbub is about .	Bart Simpson
that 's congresswoman bella abzug .	Bart Simpson
the grown-ups in this magazine are pretty cool .	Bart Simpson
i could make the treehouse look like this . then we could have orgies , whatever they are .	Bart Simpson
there it is , nice and smooth . i 'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job .	Homer Simpson
i think you used too much plaster .	Marge Simpson
oh , now you tell me .	Homer Simpson
i never stopped telling you .	Marge Simpson
so that 's what that white noise was .	Homer Simpson
i 'm calling a contractor .	Marge Simpson
thanks for taking the job . i 'm sorry my husband is being so difficult .	Marge Simpson
get lost , crook !	Homer Simpson
why do n't you just kiss her ?	Homer Simpson
when virginia woolf wrote `` every woman needs a room of one 's own , '' she must have been talking about the kitchen .	Marge Simpson
what 's the first thing you 're gon na make in your new kitchen ?	Bart Simpson
how 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars .	Homer Simpson
i was thinking of chicken wings .	Homer Simpson
those are good too .	Homer Simpson
what do you think , thomas pynchon ?	Lisa Simpson
and how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen ?	Marge Simpson
great stuff , ned .	Marge Simpson
if you win , ovenfresh industries will make you the new face of auntie ovenfresh .	Lisa Simpson
i guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything .	Marge Simpson
well , the playdude advisor says this music will get a stewardess to give you a layover .	Bart Simpson
bart , can you come in here for a second ?	Marge Simpson
your mother 's about to show us her new recipe .	Homer Simpson
outtasight ! lay it on me , mama .	Bart Simpson
in the ovenfresh bakeoff , clever presentation is as important as taste . so i 'm entering my dessert dogs !	Marge Simpson
it 's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns , cherry `` ketchup '' and caramel `` mustard . ''	Marge Simpson
it 's dessert , but it 's hot dogs , so it 's good for you !	Bart Simpson
marge , i do n't want to freak you out , but i think i love you .	Homer Simpson
i hope the ovenfresh bake-off likes them as much as you do .	Marge Simpson
mom , a letter from ovenfresh industries !	Lisa Simpson
well , open it , open it , open it !	Marge Simpson
thank you for applying to the ovenfresh bakeoff . every year many wonderful cooks fail to qualify .	Lisa Simpson
`` ... but screw them , you 're in ! congratulations ! ''	Lisa Simpson
oh my god ! someone , somewhere says i 'm better than someone else !	Marge Simpson
i 'm proud of you , honey .	Homer Simpson
my dessert !	Marge Simpson
well ...	Marge Simpson
ah nelson , your debonair wit reminds me of a young mort sahl .	Bart Simpson
listen up , ring-a-ding-dingers . i 'm throwin ' a little sip ' n ' quip at the playdude treehouse . saturday night , at the top of the ladder . be there or be square .	Bart Simpson
you 're not invited .	Bart Simpson
it 's gon na be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind . but i think i 'm up to it .	Marge Simpson
why thank you , billy .	Marge Simpson
well ... stuart , i 'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog , but it is n't .	Marge Simpson
she is not !	Marge Simpson
great licks man , great licks .	Bart Simpson
hey , it would n't be a playdude party without james caan .	Bart Simpson
come on mom ! you still have twenty minutes left -- you can fix it !	Lisa Simpson
emanations !	Lisa Simpson
i do n't , but i hope you win .	Bart Simpson
fish scales ?	Marge Simpson
stop ! you 're tainting my entry !	Marge Simpson
you did it on purpose ?	Marge Simpson
why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie ?	Marge Simpson
why ca n't everyone just play fair and ... did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl ?	Marge Simpson
adult themes ? what are you talking about ?	Homer Simpson
stupid bart . bagpipes getting down with an octopus ... that 's classic .	Homer Simpson
you 're right . if i can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week , i can do anything .	Marge Simpson
you feed us on twelve dollars a week ?	Lisa Simpson
i stretch your father 's meatloaf with sawdust .	Marge Simpson
hurry , mom !	Lisa Simpson
i guess i was the last one .	Marge Simpson
these other dishes look so pretty . and those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners . i 'd like to give those betty crookeds a taste of their own medicine . yes ... medicine .	Marge Simpson
baby ear medicine .	Marge Simpson
even the pope could n't forgive this pizza ... and he 's letting a lot of things slide these days .	Marge Simpson
do n't worry , there 's plenty for all of you ! now who 's laughing ? huh ? huh ? me ! i 'm laughing !	Marge Simpson
i ca n't believe my mom would cheat .	Lisa Simpson
hey sweetie , is mom winning ?	Homer Simpson
oh , she 'll win the contest , but she 'll lose her soul .	Lisa Simpson
but she 'll still win the contest ?	Homer Simpson
and lose her soul .	Lisa Simpson
but win the contest ?	Homer Simpson
yes .	Lisa Simpson
woo-hoo ! if marge becomes auntie ovenfresh , we 'll meet all the food personalities ...	Homer Simpson
look ! it 's mister cashew ... the koobler dwarfs ... snip , crinkle and poof ...	Homer Simpson
twinkle the kidd , i love you !	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
blood for creme ! blood for creme !	Homer Simpson
that 's an entry ? ! i thought it was garbage .	Marge Simpson
canned and frozen juices are more popular than ever these days . but most bachelors we know would prefer to squeeze their own tomatoes .	Bart Simpson
would you excuse us , milton ?	Homer Simpson
yeah , and your father 's `` no house . '' now scram .	Homer Simpson
maybe i was a little hard on him . oh , well . bart , i know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son . but what 's going on up here ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm just spreadin ' the playdude philosophy . hi-fi 's , norman mailer , gettin ' some ...	Bart Simpson
uh-um ... what do you think `` some '' is ?	Homer Simpson
uh ... toys ?	Bart Simpson
i thought i 'd never have to do this , but it 's time to tell you the facts of life .	Homer Simpson
do you know what a boob is ?	Homer Simpson
oh yeah .	Bart Simpson
good . that 'll save us some time . okay ... why do you think your mother and i sleep in the same bed ?	Homer Simpson
because we 're poor ?	Bart Simpson
exactly . and we 're poor because we have kids . and the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is ...	Homer Simpson
and then the man ...	Bart Simpson
well , it 's better they hear it from me now , than from their parents when they 're old enough .	Homer Simpson
congratulations , mom . you seem to have a prescription for success .	Lisa Simpson
what a kind yet oddly ominous thing to say . now i 've got to get ready for the finals .	Marge Simpson
do n't forget your secret ingredient ...	Lisa Simpson
cheating !	Lisa Simpson
well , it 's not my fault ! lisa , the people in this bake-off are stinkers , who pushed me and pushed me , like the pushy-wushies they are !	Marge Simpson
mom , if i do n't have you to look up to , i do n't have anyone .	Lisa Simpson
look , i 'll be a winner with feet of clay ... like mickey mantle . everyone loves the mick .	Marge Simpson
i do n't want mickey mantle , i want my mom .	Lisa Simpson
hey , plenty of kids are gon na look up to me when i 'm auntie whatever it is . right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who does n't go to work . ca n't you understand that i need this ?	Marge Simpson
i guess dad has to be my hero now .	Lisa Simpson
not if you knew what he 's been doing .	Bart Simpson
she 's already ahead of me .	Marge Simpson
well , i did n't come this far not to cheat .	Marge Simpson
i look up to you ...	Marge Simpson
... because you let me down .	Marge Simpson
that 's clever ... and devastating . stop the competition !	Marge Simpson
i do n't deserve to win . i sabotaged all the other entries !	Marge Simpson
thanks , honey , for saving me from myself .	Marge Simpson
and marge , you 'll always be the best chef in our house .	Homer Simpson
b.f.d . i 've had your scrambled eggs , homer . the secret ingredient is whiskey .	Marge Simpson
hey , it keeps the kids quiet .	Homer Simpson
hey look ! the new ovenfresh flour bag !	Lisa Simpson
that coulda been me .	Marge Simpson
check it out , girls . sixty-eight squares of ankle-busting fury !	Lisa Simpson
that 's right , a double-dogleg , hamstring-knotting hop-way to hell . what insane kangaroo dreamed this fevered nightmare ? behold !	Lisa Simpson
ladies , grab your pebbles !	Lisa Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
shut up ! i do not !	Lisa Simpson
dad , the kids at school said my butt 's big .	Lisa Simpson
that 's ridiculous , honey . you 're the cutest little girl i know . you just have what is known as the simpson butt . permit me to elaborate .	Homer Simpson
every simpson starts with a circle . daddy has one big circle here ... then a smaller one up here ... two big , sexy circles for eyes ... one macho muzzle ... and a snappy new outfit . hm , i 'm lookin ' good ... ooh , cuffs ... yeah ... and for some reason , my hair and ear form an `` m '' and a `` g . ''	Homer Simpson
party ! party ! party ! party !	Bart Simpson
you wan na know a little trick ? to downsize my derriã¨re , i just tie a sweater around it .	Homer Simpson
see ?	Homer Simpson
oh , homer , you 're wasting away to nothing . you simply must eat something . well , you 're the boss !	Homer Simpson
oh , i love to see my man eat .	Homer Simpson
check it out , homes . you said if i ever got a hundred on a test , you 'd throw me a party .	Bart Simpson
there 's my hundred -- where 's my party ?	Bart Simpson
nice try , loser . i bet you made up a fake test .	Homer Simpson
nope , it 's real -- check out the watermark .	Bart Simpson
all right .	Homer Simpson
ah-ha ! here 's a mistake . it says the capital of kentucky is frankfort . dream on , pal .	Homer Simpson
homer , the capital of kentucky is frankfort .	Marge Simpson
really ? frankfurter ... is that anything ?	Homer Simpson
yes , it 's something , dear .	Marge Simpson
see , it 's all legit . now make with the party .	Bart Simpson
all right , boy , which con did you work here ? copy off another kid ? pay attention and take notes ? well , take note of this !	Homer Simpson
i win ! p-a-r-t. par-tee !	Bart Simpson
i thought you two broke up .	Homer Simpson
maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner .	Lisa Simpson
this store makes me feel even worse about myself .	Lisa Simpson
i know ! it 's such an unrealistic standard for young ... huh ?	Lisa Simpson
hey , i do n't look so bad .	Lisa Simpson
noooooo !	Lisa Simpson
oh boy ! barty 's gon na party !	Bart Simpson
he sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals !	Marge Simpson
aunt patty , aunt selma , grandma bouvier and grampa !	Marge Simpson
plus your school-yard chums : martin and ralph !	Marge Simpson
oh mom , this guest list sucks .	Bart Simpson
it 's the best i could do on such short notice .	Marge Simpson
where 's milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
he 's got the measles . but we 've got him on speakerphone !	Marge Simpson
i told him to use a land line . okay gang , let 's get this party started -- or should i say barted ?	Marge Simpson
for our first game , i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower .	Marge Simpson
say `` goose , '' you stupid freak !	Bart Simpson
mom , this was the worst party ever .	Bart Simpson
gee , i did the best i could ...	Marge Simpson
here 's lisa ! she 'll save the party ! honey , sit down ... have a big slice of cake !	Marge Simpson
what ? ! i 'm not fat enough already ? how could you say that to me ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , wait ...	Marge Simpson
oh , what 's the big deal ? bart did n't like his presents . so what ? it 's not like he gives us such great gifts . remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper ? what was that ? that was crap .	Homer Simpson
it 's not just the presents -- the kids do n't appreciate me anymore . they 'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom .	Marge Simpson
so they 're growing up . soon they 'll be leaving the nest , and you 'll have time for yourself . hundreds of thousands of hours . and then , the peace of the grave .	Homer Simpson
no ! no , i 've got a lot more mothering left in me !	Marge Simpson
i 'll be right here at three to pick you up , then i 'll take you to the zoo ! we can eat fries out of a safari hat !	Marge Simpson
no thanks . i 'm gon na stay in the library and do a little reading .	Lisa Simpson
well , i guess it 's just you and me , bart !	Marge Simpson
mom , after that lame party you threw , i 'd rather hang out with thunder-thighs here .	Bart Simpson
they grow up so fast .	Marge Simpson
oh sure , you love me now , but you 'll turn .	Marge Simpson
are n't you the boy who beats up my son ?	Marge Simpson
those tadpoles are your lunch ?	Marge Simpson
here , take this . my daughter did n't want the lunch i made .	Marge Simpson
you do n't have to impress me by making fun of others . i already like you .	Marge Simpson
it 's nice to be appreciated .	Marge Simpson
hey , kids , i just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley . you know what that means -- open lanes !	Marge Simpson
whaddya say ? it 'll be blam ! bart , lisa and mom . huh ?	Marge Simpson
mom , when i want lame and needy , i 'll call milhouse . no offense .	Bart Simpson
fine ! i 'll take my mothering elsewhere .	Marge Simpson
great roll , nelson ! here , i cut up your hot dog for you .	Marge Simpson
you 've never had one before ?	Marge Simpson
and uh , where 's your dad in all this ?	Marge Simpson
nelson , how 'd you like to earn some extra money around our house ? i have some odd jobs my kids wo n't do .	Marge Simpson
sometimes i think he 's more interested in his `` itchy and mitchy '' cartoons than me .	Marge Simpson
that 's how we got our kaypro !	Marge Simpson
sixty-four , sixty-five , sixty-six ...	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't hear you .	Lisa Simpson
that does n't make any sense !	Lisa Simpson
i know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist ... but that 's what a fat girl would say !	Lisa Simpson
lis , look !	Bart Simpson
now , i know there 's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt .	Marge Simpson
well , maybe not . but you did a great job on the lawn .	Marge Simpson
my mother ... my bully ... my god !	Bart Simpson
lisa , just take a bite . one bite -- that 's all i ask !	Marge Simpson
now , i ca n't have toothpaste tonight .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't give your son charity . i gave him self-respect .	Marge Simpson
go home to your son , mrs. muntz . and try not to have intercourse on the way !	Marge Simpson
nelson , what are you doing out this late ?	Marge Simpson
she 's still your mother . come inside .	Marge Simpson
can i get you a glass of milk ?	Marge Simpson
uh-huh .	Marge Simpson
what are you doing in my jammies ?	Bart Simpson
but it 's a single bed .	Bart Simpson
mom , the reason god invented deadbolts is to keep people like nelson out of your house .	Bart Simpson
bart , have you ever eaten a tootsie pop ? you know , there 's a tough crunchy shell , but if you lick it , there 's a delicious sweetness inside . be nice to nelson and i 'll give you a tootsie pop .	Marge Simpson
bart , eat up or you 'll be late for school !	Marge Simpson
i 'm not hungry .	Bart Simpson
open .	Homer Simpson
nelson , does n't that hurt your teeth ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't like the sound of that . tomorrow i 'm taking you to doctor shapiro .	Marge Simpson
i 've got ta do something about him .	Bart Simpson
this is the perfect test -- if i can have one dab of frosting and then stop , i 'll know i 've conquered food at last .	Lisa Simpson
that was too easy .	Lisa Simpson
okay , if i stop here , i still have some dignity .	Lisa Simpson
well , at least she 's not singing streisand .	Bart Simpson
yeah , a little . those mean girls just get to me .	Lisa Simpson
thank you , nelson .	Lisa Simpson
i really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson .	Lisa Simpson
i 'd like that .	Lisa Simpson
well , that explains a lot . who 's hungry ?	Homer Simpson
no ! i want to hear what happened at the store !	Marge Simpson
... and that 's where i found him .	Bart Simpson
i brought him back here so he could take nelson away and my bruises would heal .	Bart Simpson
well , i 'm glad everything worked out so well .	Marge Simpson
so , now that you 're happy again , i guess you wo n't beat me up at school anymore .	Bart Simpson
they 're a family again . and so are we . what happened ?	Homer Simpson
sometimes you have to adopt your son 's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer .	Marge Simpson
and lisa , what have you learned ?	Homer Simpson
nothing . like many women , i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight .	Lisa Simpson
but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution , right ?	Homer Simpson
i guess . but there 's a long way to go .	Lisa Simpson
c'mon , say something conclusive .	Homer Simpson
i 'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem .	Lisa Simpson
open-ended ! c'mon , lisa . say everything 's fine . everything 's fine .	Homer Simpson
that was you .	Lisa Simpson
prove it .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , boy . take your pill .	Bart Simpson
mom , the dog wo n't take his medicine !	Bart Simpson
perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese .	Marge Simpson
woo hoo ! free cheese !	Homer Simpson
homer , that was for the dog .	Marge Simpson
what 's happened to us , marge ? we used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night . then came the heart attacks .	Homer Simpson
what 's that rumble ?	Marge Simpson
it 's a media circus !	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo ! the circus !	Homer Simpson
a media circus .	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo ! i do n't know the difference !	Homer Simpson
abc , cbs ... uh-oh , the christian science monitor has a flat tire !	Lisa Simpson
this is the most exciting scandal since the juice was on the loose .	Marge Simpson
the juice is still on the loose .	Lisa Simpson
she 's from springfield ! i knew her in high school .	Marge Simpson
i did n't think anyone successful came from springfield .	Bart Simpson
what about that two-headed goat ?	Homer Simpson
technically he was born in shelbyville .	Lisa Simpson
yes , but he came here to die .	Homer Simpson
one of you ate tin cans , one of you ate health food . how you solved crimes i 'll never know .	Homer Simpson
chloe sure turned out successful .	Marge Simpson
you 're successful too , mom . you made a chore wheel that 's both fair and wise .	Lisa Simpson
marge ! i figured out a way we can get in on this quimby lawsuit ! bart , go ahead .	Homer Simpson
mayah quimby is my er ah , fathah . give me one million dollahs !	Bart Simpson
huh ? huh ?	Homer Simpson
chloe , hi !	Marge Simpson
evergreen terrace .	Marge Simpson
terrace . evergreen terrace . the street that smells like pee . this is my daughter , lisa .	Marge Simpson
chloe , i really admire how you got out of springfield and became such a success .	Lisa Simpson
well , it is good to see you , chloe . would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow ?	Marge Simpson
i sawed you on the television .	Homer Simpson
i believe it was the school 's tuba .	Homer Simpson
chloe , these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything i 've ever had at this table .	Homer Simpson
homer .	Marge Simpson
oh marge , i 'm just being polite .	Homer Simpson
more !	Homer Simpson
harper 's magazine ! i have a picture of lewis lapham on my binder .	Lisa Simpson
well ... oh . we finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day . turns out he had an impacted anal gland .	Marge Simpson
the excitement never stops . chloe , would you like to see slides of our trip to athens ... boulevard recreational center ?	Marge Simpson
i guess .	Marge Simpson
you know , chloe , some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place .	Marge Simpson
oh come on , marge . the only reason we do n't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet .	Homer Simpson
i 'm here ! i 'm here ! quit buggin ' me !	Homer Simpson
homer , why do you always have to show that to company ?	Marge Simpson
it 's a conversation starter !	Homer Simpson
homer , what are you doing ?	Marge Simpson
i swallowed a chicken bone .	Homer Simpson
chloe , you 've lived so many fascinating places .	Lisa Simpson
gee , with all that travel , you probably have n't had much time to find that special someone .	Marge Simpson
did you just swallow another bone ?	Marge Simpson
same one .	Homer Simpson
chloe is amazing -- even her serving bowl smells glamorous .	Lisa Simpson
that 's ridiculous . no one 's bowl smells ... it 's like christmas in aspen .	Marge Simpson
did you know back in high school that she 'd be such a star ?	Lisa Simpson
back then , we were both stars - in the thrill-a-minute world of high school journalism .	Marge Simpson
together we broke the biggest story of the semester -- one of the cafeteria workers was spitting in the soup .	Marge Simpson
miasmas !	Lisa Simpson
when we published the story , we received the school 's highest award .	Marge Simpson
oh , that moe . but good for you , mom ! why did n't you follow chloe into journalism ?	Lisa Simpson
well , we both faced a tough decision ... go off to journalism school , or stay in springfield with our sweethearts ?	Marge Simpson
chloe left town as soon as barney proposed . i would 've followed her , but my plans changed when god brought me a wonderful little boy ... bart , stop that !	Marge Simpson
this is n't what it looks like .	Bart Simpson
why would homer write his name in grime ?	Marge Simpson
that 's better .	Marge Simpson
well , i just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons . where 's the award for that ?	Marge Simpson
oh , mom , do n't feel bad . everybody appreciates your ... uh-oh , i 'm late for my dinner ... with chloe !	Lisa Simpson
good news , marge !	Homer Simpson
i 've learned to walk naked on stilts !	Homer Simpson
there 's `` dan rather '' and `` tom brokaw '' , hanging out with kent brockman !	Lisa Simpson
chloe has such an amazing life . i wonder what would have happened if i 'd stuck with journalism .	Marge Simpson
oh honey , her life ca n't compare to yours . you 've got three kids , a tv tray from expo sixty-seven , and you 're married to king stink !	Homer Simpson
yeah , i guess .	Marge Simpson
marge , listen to me . chloe may have a flashy job , but you 're the backbone of this family . you 're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together .	Homer Simpson
that 's a sweet thought , homie .	Marge Simpson
i just hate to see you upset , honey . you know what would be a good name for maggie ? chloe .	Homer Simpson
that was such an exciting night . morley safer has the biggest head i 've ever seen .	Lisa Simpson
it 's gon na be a let-down going to school tomorrow . we have to make a pilgrim out of felt .	Lisa Simpson
oh ! that 'd be wonderful ! oh i 'd -- i 'd have to ask my mom .	Lisa Simpson
how dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility ?	Marge Simpson
for your information , our electric dishwasher is on the fritz .	Marge Simpson
not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances . do ya ? huh , do ya ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm so sick of names !	Marge Simpson
ladies ! there 's no need to fight over me .	Homer Simpson
no one 's fighting over you !	Marge Simpson
oh . well then , carry on .	Homer Simpson
shiner be gone .	Marge Simpson

a shirt from that rap concert ... bart must 've gone to the show . but that means ...	Lisa Simpson
... bart was never kidnapped ! lisa , i 'm very glad you brought me this . i 'll see that it gets to the proper authorities .	Homer Simpson
dad ! ? why did you do that ?	Lisa Simpson
hollywood producers have paid me a fortune , which i 've already lost , for the rights to bart 's story . so i have to destroy anything that proves that story 's not true .	Homer Simpson
why did you burn up your shirt ?	Lisa Simpson
what shirt ? i do n't see any shirt .	Homer Simpson
burn the truth . burn the truth .	Homer Simpson
so you see principal skinner , that 's why i had to come to you .	Lisa Simpson
it does n't matter . the point is , only with your help can i expose bart 's lies .	Lisa Simpson
you leave maggie to me .	Homer Simpson
not her ! she 'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer !	Homer Simpson
people , please . the only way lisa can bust me is if she finds someone who can prove i was at that rap show . and i know just where she can find that someone . let 's go cover our asses !	Bart Simpson
wow , those jackets are beautiful .	Homer Simpson
mr. alcatraaaz , my name is lisa simpson , and this is principal skinner .	Lisa Simpson
homer is a fat load !	Bart Simpson
this proves bart lied about being kidnapped !	Lisa Simpson

the lie is love .	Homer Simpson
wait just a minute .	Lisa Simpson
love the lie !	Homer Simpson
the way i was raised , by mom , i learned the truth ca n't be swept under the rug .	Lisa Simpson
that 's a very noble sentiment , lisa . but for once in your life , ca n't you just be cool ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , be cool . like us .	Homer Simpson
coolee , coolee cool ! c'mon , fool ! be coolee , coolee cool !	Homer Simpson
dad , i do n't understand . after all the corruption and deceit we 've witnessed , how can everyone just party ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , the world is a very complicated place . and when you get right down to it ... cannonball !	Homer Simpson
some sucker will think he 's getting beer , but he 's really gon na get a face full of melon !	Bart Simpson

eh , who needs tourists ? they never buy my maps to stars ' homes , anyway .	Homer Simpson
have you read them all ? okay , good .	Homer Simpson
i have a real suggestion .	Lisa Simpson
why do n't we legalize same-sex marriage ? we can attract a growing segment of the marriage market , and strike a blow for civil rights .	Lisa Simpson
excuse me , reverend .	Marge Simpson
as long as two people love each other , i do n't think god cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha .	Marge Simpson
which book ?	Marge Simpson
but reverend ... scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for christians of many of the old testament 's proscriptions .	Marge Simpson
jesus ' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion ...	Marge Simpson
two hundred bucks a couple , eh ?	Homer Simpson
hey , i got ta get in on this ! these people have rights ! the right to buy me a sixty-two inch tv !	Homer Simpson
now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister .	Homer Simpson

if you love the bible so much , why do n't you marry it ? in fact , i now pronounce you and the bible man and wife . and you 're the wife . you owe me two hundred bucks .	Homer Simpson
which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages . which will put more green in the blue . the blue being my pants .	Homer Simpson
oh homie , i 'm so proud of you . you stood up for people 's right to express love in its most perfect form , a binding legal contract .	Marge Simpson
lem me get my belt sander . maybe i can grind the ugly off your face .	Homer Simpson

oh no . no no . no . i 'm just ... surprised .	Marge Simpson
yeah , big surprise . hey marge , here 's another bomb : i like beer .	Homer Simpson
so patty . you 're a woman who likes women . i guess that fear i always had of you stealing homer away is unfounded .	Marge Simpson
marge , i 'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister patty .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess i could have seen the signs .	Marge Simpson
oh no . oh no . why would it be ? i love you and i love gay marriage , so i 'd be a super-hypocrite if i did n't love your gay marriage . right ?	Marge Simpson
now patty , here 's a veil i picked out just for you .	Homer Simpson
give it back !	Homer Simpson
why are we dressed as sunday best simpsons for dinner with aunt patty ?	Lisa Simpson
because she 's bringing over someone very special . her fiancã©e .	Marge Simpson

son , that 's the stupidest idea i ever heard . and i know exactly who would pay top dollar for it .	Homer Simpson
actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky ... woman .	Marge Simpson
i thought you said aunt patty was just waiting for the right man .	Lisa Simpson
as opposed to you , who grabbed the first blimp that floated by .	Bart Simpson

you handsome devil . someday they 'll let you and me get married ! can you imagine the children ?	Homer Simpson
the toilet seat 's up !	Marge Simpson

well , i 've learned a lesson . just because you 're a lesbian , it does n't make you less of a bein ' .	Marge Simpson
patty , i admire your decision . it takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony . so i 'm gon na waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge .	Homer Simpson

flanders , you saw ray on the roof with me !	Homer Simpson

there has to be someone who saw him -- someone who does n't hate me like flanders and bart ... wait ! the bartender at knockers .	Homer Simpson
i called that bosom bar . the bartender said you were there alone .	Marge Simpson

bart , do n't use that word ... oh crap .	Marge Simpson
i brought you some weak tea and dry toast .	Lisa Simpson
no fair , lisa did n't get sick .	Bart Simpson
it 's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it 's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins , minerals and trace amounts of bug feces .	Lisa Simpson
i think it 's staying down . it 's staying down ! it 's not staying down .	Homer Simpson

i hope we did n't camp out here for nothing . it 's like every kid in springfield showed up .	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry about the competition , sweetie . whenever i enter a contest i tell myself i 'm going to win because , sometimes , if you believe hard enough , god cuts you a break . after all , he works for us . our prayers pay his salary .	Marge Simpson
and if i win , i 'll be on itchy and scratchy ...	Lisa Simpson
nicely done , wind-dancer . but seriously , cruelty to animals is no laughing matter . you can make a difference !	Lisa Simpson
and remember , save the violence for cartoons !	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't believe i used to date him .	Lisa Simpson
lis , you 're a shoo-in .	Bart Simpson
lisa , that sounds like a fancier version of the song you 're going to sing !	Marge Simpson
and she 's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime . oh , thank you for this angel , lord !	Homer Simpson
there 's no way i 'm gon na beat her .	Lisa Simpson
why ? just because she sings like whitney houston brought to life ?	Bart Simpson

my kitty died on christmas eve	Lisa Simpson
daddy told me to be brave	Lisa Simpson
but instead of singing carols / i was digging snowball 's grave ...	Lisa Simpson

bernie , if you please .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm in the final two / i should be happy / but all i want to do / is spend more time with my pappy ... now that you 're gone , dad , i miss you so much / and your threats against teamsters and techies and such / your management style is like attila the hun / you were vicious , malicious , but you got the job done ...	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry i hurt you , but please do n't be sad / you 're no longer my coach , but you 're always my dad ...	Lisa Simpson
dad , you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we 've spent together . i do n't care if i win , just as long as you 're in my corner again .	Lisa Simpson

it 's the title of the movie .	Lisa Simpson

this movie will haunt me for the rest of my life , just like cannonball run two .	Homer Simpson
marge ... what if the rapture is coming and i have n't led a good enough life ? i could be ... left below !	Homer Simpson
sweetie , do n't worry . god would n't spring the rapture on us unannounced . he 'd send us signs , like , i do n't know , all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving .	Marge Simpson
yeah , i 'll bet the cats would be psyched about that . thanks marge , you 've put my mind at ease . now how about a little `` rapture '' for mama ?	Homer Simpson

marge is right -- the rapture is n't coming ! there have n't been any ominous signs !	Homer Simpson
blood is raining from the sky !	Homer Simpson
judgment day is at hand .	Homer Simpson

homer , you did n't touch your second dinner tonight . and you 're reading books ! word books ! what 's going on ?	Marge Simpson
marge , the rapture is nigh . these books will help me figure out how nigh .	Homer Simpson
this whole deal is scientifically proven . the book of revelation has four hundred and four verses ... add the number of people at the last supper ...	Homer Simpson
... minus the number of filipinos in the bible ... and you get ...	Homer Simpson
he writes `` 3150518 '' on the board .	Homer Simpson

that 's what we 've been trying to tell you !	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah .	Homer Simpson
what 's this ? goodbye springfield ...	Homer Simpson
last-diddily-ast ? he 's gone ! and it 's all someone 's fault !	Homer Simpson
well , homer , you 've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want . but at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let 's be on our best behavior , okay ?	Marge Simpson
do n't worry , marge . i 've taken every precaution .	Homer Simpson
this is so humiliating .	Bart Simpson

i submit ! i submit !	Bart Simpson

after the party .	Homer Simpson
no , i wan na make you a respecting stock . i do n't know if you 've noticed , but i 've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years ...	Homer Simpson
shut up , flanders . but some things i could never take from you : your kindness , your gentle spirit ...	Homer Simpson
... and your infinite patience with a big , dumb jerk like me . oh , ned , i do n't deserve you as a neighbor , but will you forgive a young , handsome fool and come home ?	Homer Simpson
i am a little pudgy . you got me . yeah .	Homer Simpson
i saw my advantage and i took it . that 's what heroes do .	Homer Simpson

boy , i ca n't believe you got expelled . well , do n't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that 's my thing !	Homer Simpson
bart , a school-sponsored medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl 's life , and you ruined it . you deserve to be expelled .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't do it ! mom , you believe me , do n't you ?	Bart Simpson
bart , i love you . but sometimes i do n't love your choices . now we have to find another school for you .	Marge Simpson
and if you get kicked out of that one , you 're going straight in the army . where you 'll be sent straight to america 's latest military quagmire . where will it be ? north korea ? iran ? anything 's possible with commander cuckoo bananas in charge .	Homer Simpson
bart , this could be a good new school ... oakwood academy ! huh ?	Marge Simpson
mom , that 's a school for the blind .	Bart Simpson
think of the leg up you 'd have !	Marge Simpson
how can we afford any of these private schools ? they 're all so expensive . if we want to throw good money after bad , why do n't we just get grampa that new pacemaker ?	Homer Simpson
get 'em from the smoke detector .	Homer Simpson
what if there 's a fire ?	Marge Simpson
the smoke will wake us up .	Homer Simpson

i did n't need that new fact ! now i forgot who won bud bowl eight . boy , i 'm pulling you outta that crazy school !	Homer Simpson
stealing pairs of what ? hubcaps ? reeboks ? human eyes ?	Bart Simpson
cool .	Bart Simpson
st. sebastian was a pious roman soldier ...	Bart Simpson
for preaching christianity to the romans , the emperor diocletian sentenced him to death by hail of arrows .	Bart Simpson
whoa , this stuff is great ! it 's way better than the comics i get at the dentist .	Bart Simpson
... then father sean quoted eminem in his sermon . and in art class , we painted saint joan burning at the stake , and mine was the grossest ! catholics rock !	Bart Simpson
bart , i 'm glad you had fun , but i would n't get too into that catholic church . with all the sitting and standing and kneeling , it 's like simon says without a winner !	Marge Simpson
mom , that 's blasphemy ! i 'll say a rosary for you .	Bart Simpson
do n't you touch bead one ! homer , maybe we should be concerned . catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control , no meat on friday ...	Marge Simpson
no meat ? ! what do they eat , light bulbs ?	Homer Simpson
let 's just change the subject . bart , would you like to say grace ?	Marge Simpson
yes 'm . anima patri , et filio , et spiritui sancto ...	Bart Simpson
bart ! what the hell are you saying ?	Homer Simpson
that 's latin , dad . the language of plutarch .	Lisa Simpson

wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . no matter what i did , no matter how many people lost their pensions , it 's forgiven like that ?	Homer Simpson
okay , let 's make some magic here . i wiped a booger on your shirt , i made a dog and a cat kiss , i swiped a bolted-down tv from a holiday inn ...	Homer Simpson
sorry mom , but this is the catholic church . chicks do n't have any authority here .	Bart Simpson
... i coveted the wife in `` jaws 2 , '' i lied to a waiter , i masturbated eight million times and i have no plans to stop masturbating in the future .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! i 'm clean ! in your face , lord !	Homer Simpson

woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
homer , you 've been out all night ! and you look like you 've accepted someone as your personal something . were you at that catholic church ? !	Marge Simpson
look , marge , i know i was supposed to yell at that priest , but he 's so cool . he plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests !	Homer Simpson
i knew they 'd try to convert you ! that 's what they do ! well i 'm not having another twelve kids .	Marge Simpson
marge , no one is saying twelve . nine , ten , tops . see ...	Homer Simpson
forget it ! and you know , i went to a catholic wedding once . the incense ruined my pantsuit !	Marge Simpson
marge , relax . i 've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion .	Homer Simpson
well , homer and bart are well , they 're under the weather .	Marge Simpson
all right ! i admit it -- they 're both at the catholic church ! reverend , what should i do ?	Marge Simpson
i guess it 's good that they 're taking an interest in spirituality .	Marge Simpson
where 's homer and bart ?	Marge Simpson

welcome to the jungle , kevin !	Homer Simpson
first communion ? !	Marge Simpson
marge , what are you doing here ?	Homer Simpson
homer , you 're physically an adult , and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business . but i did n't change bart 's diapers for five years to see him become a catholic .	Marge Simpson
i thought there was a monster in the potty .	Bart Simpson
let 's go !	Marge Simpson
they were n't following us .	Marge Simpson
why did you guys have to take me away ? you 're always nagging me to go to church , and now that i am , it 's the wrong one .	Bart Simpson
i just do n't think your father 's the right person to pick out a religion for you .	Marge Simpson
okay , i 'll pick a religion for me . judaism .	Bart Simpson
do n't have ... a cow man / do n't have ... a cow man / do n't have ... a cow man / have a piece of fish ! oy !	Bart Simpson
hello , homer .	Marge Simpson
marge , you bring bart home now ! once you go vatican , you ca n't go back again .	Homer Simpson
it was n't a fair fight ! your church suckered him in with gory stories , just like we were suckered into getting cinemax .	Marge Simpson
face it , marge -- catholics rule . we 've got boston , south america , the good part of ireland , and we 're making serious inroads in mozambique , baby !	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm gon na show bart that protestants can be hip too . how do you like those croutons ?	Marge Simpson
why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children ? should n't bart and i be able to choose our own religion if we want to ?	Homer Simpson
strange as it sounds , dad , i agree with you .	Lisa Simpson
bwa ?	Homer Simpson
everyone should be able to choose their faith -- just like i chose buddhism .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll ignore that . in fact , i 'm gon na help you . i have a pretty good idea where they are .	Lisa Simpson
now bart , is n't this the kind of religion you 'd like to be a part of for all eternity ?	Marge Simpson
what 's wrong , bart ? you love youth culture !	Marge Simpson
mom , a religion is n't cool just because they 've glommed onto some crappy rock band from the nineteen forties .	Bart Simpson
you just do n't get it . i 've made a sacred commitment to the catholic church , and ... paintball ! awesome !	Bart Simpson
die ! die ! die !	Bart Simpson
oh bart , i knew one of these dumb things would work !	Marge Simpson
my hive ! my trademark hive !	Marge Simpson
hop in , boy ! we 'll show your mother our god kicks her god 's butt .	Homer Simpson
easy on the zeal , church-os ! i 've got something to say .	Bart Simpson
do n't you get it -- it 's all christianity , people ! the little stupid differences are nothing next to the big stupid similarities !	Bart Simpson
c'mon broncos ... you can do it ...	Homer Simpson
the broncos won ? ! why did n't i bet on them , like professor pigskin told me to ?	Homer Simpson
who 's professor pigskin ?	Lisa Simpson
he 's a pig who can predict football winners ... in advance !	Homer Simpson
how is that possible ?	Lisa Simpson
because he 's got something no gambler 's ever had : a system .	Homer Simpson
i 've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row , and every time , the `` pick of the week '' has been right on the money .	Homer Simpson
i get it . every week they send out two pamphlets , half picking one team and half picking the other . eventually , there 's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think professor pigskin is always right ! that 's when they ask for your money .	Lisa Simpson
i have money !	Homer Simpson
dad , it 's a scam !	Lisa Simpson
a scam ? not according to `` eddie f. from tucson , '' or `` football millionaire in beloit , michigan . ''	Homer Simpson
look , all i 'm saying is , you really should think twice before ...	Lisa Simpson
... expiration date oh-six oh-eight .	Homer Simpson
professor pigskin told me to bet on the raiders but they look awful .	Homer Simpson
dad , how much money did you bet ?	Lisa Simpson
hey , i did n't bet any of our money . i just borrowed some from him .	Homer Simpson
it 's not my fault the raiders lost , it 's professor pigskin 's !	Homer Simpson
but the pig !	Homer Simpson
marge would kill me ! please , there 's got ta be something else i can do . like mow your lawn every week for two weeks . i ca n't do it next week .	Homer Simpson
all right , you can shoot your gay adult film at my house .	Homer Simpson
they 're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow . how am i gon na get rid of marge and the kids ?	Homer Simpson
thanks , moe !	Homer Simpson

oh , just great . things could n't be better .	Homer Simpson
she , uh , was killed by a falling air conditioner .	Homer Simpson

wow . i can see why she loves you .	Homer Simpson
you know everything .	Homer Simpson
and what a man !	Homer Simpson
okay , the key to this thing is the manatees . is marge saving them or killing them ?	Homer Simpson
saving !	Lisa Simpson
okay . to save the manatees , i guess i could donate my time and money and help them build a ... eh , screw that .	Homer Simpson
dad ! those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees !	Bart Simpson
why do n't you pick on someone your own size ?	Homer Simpson
look , if it were up to me , i 'd be harassing them with you . if anything , i 'd be the guy who took it too far . but i love my wife and i want to win her back !	Homer Simpson

homer ! do something about the noise !	Marge Simpson
flanders , i ca n't listen to your crap before my coffee .	Homer Simpson
stupid best friend flanders .	Homer Simpson
a stamp museum ?	Bart Simpson
stamps ? those are for snail mail ! stamps rule ! i mean suck !	Homer Simpson
well , they just ca n't start building in our neighborhood without asking us . what ever happened to `` please '' and `` thank you '' ?	Marge Simpson
i think they killed each other . you know , one of those murder-suicide deals .	Homer Simpson
we have to stop all this construction . the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jell-o .	Marge Simpson
what man would want this now ? !	Homer Simpson
two four six eight ! i hate stamps ! they are n't great !	Homer Simpson
okay , how about this ? seven , four three one ... oh wait , that 's my pin number . everyone forget that .	Homer Simpson
again ! again !	Bart Simpson
again !	Bart Simpson
again !	Bart Simpson
that 's enough .	Bart Simpson
instead of a stamp museum we 'll be next door to a graveyard ? !	Marge Simpson
look at the bright side , marge . when i die , you can mourn me from the bathroom . that 's multi-tasking .	Homer Simpson
this is a little too spooky for me . i do n't even like watching `` the count '' on sesame street .	Marge Simpson
go back to your own country !	Marge Simpson
this stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery !	Lisa Simpson
then the zombies will eat you first , and you wo n't have to watch 'em eat us .	Bart Simpson
thanks for making me feel better .	Lisa Simpson
well , thanks for making me feel better , knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so i can get away .	Bart Simpson
there 's no such thing as zombies !	Lisa Simpson
oh , glad to hear you say that -- because the person who does n't believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon .	Bart Simpson
stop scaring me !	Lisa Simpson
bart , do n't you have homework to do ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , and i could really use your help .	Bart Simpson
i believe in science and reality , not ghosts and monsters !	Lisa Simpson
can i sleep with you guys tonight ?	Lisa Simpson
oh sure you can , sweetie . just do n't make a habit of it .	Marge Simpson
okay , just let me clear some space .	Homer Simpson
so that 's why i 've been smelling margaritas at three a.m .	Marge Simpson
hey , i love waking up drunk in the morning .	Homer Simpson
lisa , honey . i know last night was tough , but all our kids sleep by themselves . we do n't even hear maggie cry at night anymore !	Marge Simpson
oh , wait a minute . there 's no batteries in this thing .	Marge Simpson
i , uh , needed them for my remote control helicopter .	Homer Simpson
tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed , because ... homer , stop that !	Marge Simpson
there 's a little plastic man in your hair and i 'm trying to rescue him .	Homer Simpson
no soldier left behind .	Homer Simpson
noooo !	Marge Simpson
homer , can you help me out here ?	Marge Simpson
lisa , honey , if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow , we 'll do something special , just for you .	Homer Simpson
well , i heard they finished the stamp museum . that could be fun .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't believe it took us forty minutes to get here . why ca n't they build a stamp museum closer to our house ?	Homer Simpson
dad , you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , when you 've sustained as many blows to the head as i have , consistency is something , something that , something i love you , bart .	Homer Simpson
is n't this lenny 's house ?	Marge Simpson
i thought it was twenty .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you 're making money off this !	Homer Simpson
no one 's gon na pay a buck to drink water from your hose --	Homer Simpson
pay the man , homer .	Bart Simpson
wow , look at all these worthy americans ...	Lisa Simpson
butter face .	Homer Simpson
the land of the wild beasts ? that 's the first book i read all the way through .	Lisa Simpson
you read a book all the way through ? why ?	Bart Simpson
lisa , do you really want to watch this ?	Marge Simpson
all right , commercials !	Bart Simpson
that 's bull man .	Homer Simpson
groundskeeper willie ?	Lisa Simpson
what a lousy party .	Marge Simpson
i do n't care what apu was in a past life . in this life , he 's a blabbermouth !	Marge Simpson
oh , and that dr. hibbert was so boring ... `` homer , we 've got to get that lump checked out ... homer , we must discuss your test results ... homer , we 've got to find you a donor ... '' blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ...	Homer Simpson
i thought those people were your friends .	Lisa Simpson
look who 's sleeping in our bed again .	Marge Simpson
i did n't know grownups said bad things about other grownups .	Lisa Simpson
lisa !	Homer Simpson
you see , sweetie , when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about , they bad-mouth their closest friends .	Homer Simpson
but i thought it was wrong to talk about people behind their backs .	Lisa Simpson
i spy with my little eye , a girl who 's not sleeping in her room like she promised .	Marge Simpson
i know . i 'm sorry .	Lisa Simpson
oh , and i spy with my little eye something with four legs that ca n't run .	Homer Simpson
homer , we 're not really playing .	Marge Simpson
is it the chair ?	Lisa Simpson
exactly . now , what has two ears but ca n't hear ?	Homer Simpson
grampa ?	Lisa Simpson
tragically , yes .	Homer Simpson
what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened ? hm ?	Marge Simpson
okay , marge . but do n't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up .	Homer Simpson
well , i hope he 's accompanied by the `` how was your day '' monster , and the `` foot rub '' monster and the let me just ...	Marge Simpson
do n't worry , he 's not showin ' up .	Homer Simpson
boy , lisa 's room really is scary .	Homer Simpson
finally , back in the only safe bedroom in the house .	Homer Simpson
what about bart 's bedroom ?	Lisa Simpson
you know that racecar bed i made him ?	Homer Simpson
yeah .	Lisa Simpson
the brakes are shot .	Homer Simpson
ow . ow . ow . ow . ow . ow .	Bart Simpson
lisa , honey . any chance you can stop reading soon ?	Marge Simpson
okay , i 'll watch tv .	Lisa Simpson
mom , i think there 's a danger this time they might lose the ponderosa !	Lisa Simpson
ow .	Bart Simpson
learn to drive , boy !	Homer Simpson
we need professional help .	Marge Simpson
frankly , no . lisa kind of took care of herself . our oldest , bart , was such a handful .	Marge Simpson
uh ... this is all i could find .	Homer Simpson
why you very little ... !	Homer Simpson
homer , stop that !	Marge Simpson
stationary camera .	Homer Simpson
four thousand dollars ? !	Marge Simpson
now marge , when our little girl 's happiness is at stake ...	Homer Simpson
run , marge ! start the car !	Homer Simpson
and you wo n't ... unless you can leap through fire !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't keep sleeping in mom and dad 's room .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , if dad ever rolls over , you 're dead .	Bart Simpson
mom showed me how to make a retaining wall out of pillows . but i 'm gon na conquer my fears ... tonight .	Lisa Simpson
i 've changed my mind ! can you please open the gate ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa ! lisa !	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , we 're not evil spirits .	Marge Simpson
if i can just spend the night here , i 'll never be scared again . and boy , you 're free to go home whenever you want .	Lisa Simpson
hi , dr. nick .	Lisa Simpson
bye , dr. nick .	Lisa Simpson
we do n't go to you anymore . we have a better doctor .	Lisa Simpson
okay , got ta keep calm . if scooby doo has taught me anything , it 's that the only thing to fear are crooked real estate developers .	Lisa Simpson
where 's lisa , boy ? this book 's gon na solve all her problems .	Homer Simpson
well , if you 're lookin ' for lisa , she said she was gon na spend the night in the boneyard out back .	Bart Simpson
the cemetery ? and you 're just sitting here ?	Marge Simpson
i figured the best thing i could do is monitor the news for any reports .	Bart Simpson
you 're watching cartoons !	Marge Simpson
hey mom , can we have fried chicken for dinner ?	Bart Simpson
although if we were evil spirits , we 'd probably assume the shape of your parents .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
marge , we owe her the truth !	Homer Simpson
where am i ?	Lisa Simpson
not scared ... not scared ...	Lisa Simpson
but i 'm too smart to get scared .	Lisa Simpson
you know , you monsters seem scary , but when you get a little closer you 're just funny .	Lisa Simpson
but wait . how am i supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window ?	Lisa Simpson
my dad says they 're too expensive .	Lisa Simpson
i think i 'll be okay by myself .	Lisa Simpson
bye , guys . you really helped me a lot .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , honey , please wake up . if you do , i 'll get you a new pony .	Homer Simpson
new pony ?	Lisa Simpson
uh ... this is still part of your dream . dreaming ... dreaming ... now you 're awake .	Homer Simpson

i think i 'm gon na be fine . let 's get some breakfast .	Lisa Simpson
maggie !	Marge Simpson
that 's not what you do with a hymnal . homer !	Marge Simpson
i forgot to floss this morning !	Homer Simpson
something 's wrong with maggie . we should get her to dr. hibbert . but i do n't see him anywhere .	Marge Simpson
this is awesome ! black god rules !	Bart Simpson
dr. hibbert ?	Marge Simpson
i hate to interrupt while you 're rejoicing , but maggie is terribly itchy .	Marge Simpson
amen !	Marge Simpson
praise the lord , i can walk again ! what , my foot fell asleep .	Homer Simpson
sweetie , i know it itches , but you 've got ta stop scratching !	Marge Simpson

homer , do n't touch her ! you 've never had chicken pox .	Marge Simpson
i know , and you did , and you 're great .	Homer Simpson
oh , i 'm just saying it 's very dangerous if you get it as an adult ! it could leave you sterile down there .	Marge Simpson
oh . you always got ta work blue , do n't ya marge ?	Homer Simpson
you 're better than that .	Homer Simpson
ca n't even go in my own kitchen ... bart 's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters .	Homer Simpson
mmm . do n't worry , dad . i 'm saving one for you .	Bart Simpson
i 'll just leave it here in the dog 's mouth .	Bart Simpson
noooo ! bart , that 's a really bad storage area !	Homer Simpson
i dunno , maybe . plus my wife wo n't let me inside because the baby 's got chicken pox .	Homer Simpson
why would you do that ? are you a bad parent ?	Homer Simpson
so you want maggie to infect your kids ?	Homer Simpson
and would they pay handsomely for the privilege ?	Homer Simpson
... fifteen dollars to infect your kids !	Homer Simpson
now featuring the pox box ! pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women . like any disease box , results may vary . pox box !	Homer Simpson
what do you think ?	Bart Simpson
welcome to our pox party . save room for punch -- maggie 's bathing in the bowl !	Marge Simpson
oh kirk , come join the parents in the kitchen . we 're having alcohol drinks , and dishing on the parents who are n't here .	Marge Simpson
ladies and gentlemen , presenting ... the sister with the blisters ... the tot with all the spots ... maggie !	Homer Simpson
chief , do n't you think you 've had enough ?	Marge Simpson
look , why do n't you both stay and have one of my marge-aritas ?	Marge Simpson
now kids , in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things , please welcome mr. krusty the clown !	Homer Simpson
goodbye , thanks for coming . if my party made you sick , tell your friends !	Homer Simpson
you think that 's traumatic .	Bart Simpson
mr. stomach , are you hungry ? i 'm always hungry . now make with the pizza , fatso . you 're the stomach !	Homer Simpson
i have to do this for work .	Homer Simpson

i do n't know . i kept away from maggie all day .	Homer Simpson
i 'm so itchy !	Homer Simpson

y'ello ? no , i 'm not coming into work . i have chicken pox . i know i said that last month , but i was lying .	Homer Simpson
right ... right ... right ... right ... okay ... right . i love you , bye !	Homer Simpson
i just got fired . better check the `` want ads . ''	Homer Simpson
ooh ! `` truck drivers needed in iraq . ''	Homer Simpson
trucks are like big cars .	Homer Simpson
and i always got the spillover . drive-in movies , two christmases , soda with dinner -- we lived like kings !	Bart Simpson
that was some new years . now listen . i think we should consider breaking your parents up again .	Bart Simpson
look , you know they 're gon na separate again . so why do n't we just speed up the process ?	Bart Simpson
that 's why he had to go away forever .	Bart Simpson
i 'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain .	Bart Simpson
you 'd better hope not , 'cause you know what comes next ? your worst nightmare : a baby sister .	Bart Simpson
hi , bart . i baked you some cookies .	Lisa Simpson
skanks for nothing , lamerella .	Bart Simpson
if you two do n't mind , i 'd like to watch that cool fox show about teenagers in orange county .	Lisa Simpson
i bet that bra was planted by sterling , to break them up .	Lisa Simpson
that 's a brilliant idea . those tv writers are geniuses !	Bart Simpson
this bra is really gon na lift and separate : lift your mother 's suspicions and separate your parents !	Bart Simpson
okey-doke . and you are ...	Homer Simpson
will she know what this is regarding ?	Homer Simpson
that 's ridiculous ! no woman would want to have sex with that loser ! and , uh , congratulations on snagging him back . good stuff .	Homer Simpson
this-this is marge 's bra . i bought it for her boobs !	Homer Simpson
of all the people for marge to cheat on , why did it have to be me ?	Homer Simpson
oh boy , am i beat ! if you wan na return a melon to the grocery store , clear your day !	Marge Simpson
well , that answers the mystery of the missing melon , but i have one more question : did you sleep with kirk van houten ?	Homer Simpson
how could you ask me that ?	Marge Simpson
i repeat : did you sleep with kirk ?	Homer Simpson
homer , you 're crazy !	Marge Simpson
you 're not saying no .	Homer Simpson
fine ... no !	Marge Simpson
i 'm still not hearing no .	Homer Simpson
no , no , no !	Marge Simpson
well , methinks the lady doth protest too much !	Homer Simpson
you do n't trust me ? after i salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body ! how dare you !	Marge Simpson
get out of this house !	Marge Simpson
gladly .	Homer Simpson
we tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine !	Bart Simpson
dad , i thought mom kicked you out of the house .	Lisa Simpson
i came to get my mail .	Homer Simpson
resident ... occupant ... i ca n't open these . ooh , a traffic ticket !	Homer Simpson
i 'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back .	Homer Simpson
okay look , you and mom can fix this . what exactly happened between the two of you ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , we do n't need to know how . it 's just a natural thing that happens , like a hurricane or going to war .	Bart Simpson
well , i 'd better go .	Homer Simpson
where are you staying ?	Lisa Simpson
you know the four seasons ? well , i 'm experiencing them first hand , because i 'm living in the park .	Homer Simpson
bart , i think you 're behind this whole thing .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , i can see how you 'd think that . but on the other hand ...	Bart Simpson
i can read you like a book .	Lisa Simpson
ha , ha , you read books .	Bart Simpson
if you do n't tell mom what you did , i will .	Lisa Simpson
oh come on , would n't it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men ? meanwhile , i 'll be one of those weird guys who 's thirty-five and shows up at high school basketball games .	Bart Simpson
why did i marry that selfish jerk ? i 've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times , and he never does !	Marge Simpson
uh , mom ?	Bart Simpson
hi , sweetie .	Marge Simpson
uh ... you know that bra that broke up our family ?	Bart Simpson
uh-hmm .	Marge Simpson
well , i looked into it , and it turns out i was responsible .	Bart Simpson
really ? well , just for that i 'm gon na erase all the saved games on your playstation .	Marge Simpson
what ? ! how do you know about things like that ?	Bart Simpson
i learned about it in here .	Marge Simpson
but now dad can come home , right ?	Bart Simpson
no .	Marge Simpson
but he 's innocent .	Bart Simpson
innocent ? ! after all i do for your father , he still does n't trust me . i 'm finished with him .	Marge Simpson
does this mean you and dad might get a d-a-v-u-r-s ?	Bart Simpson
young man , you go work on your spelling ... or i 'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone !	Marge Simpson
nooo ! ! ! ! !	Bart Simpson
milhouse , our reverse parent trap just made everything worse .	Bart Simpson
the other likes to chase a cow	Bart Simpson
how many times do i have to tell you : no rodgers and hammerstein !	Bart Simpson
no !	Bart Simpson
enough with the tricks !	Lisa Simpson
stupid movie schemes do not work in real life . mom and dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it does n't shatter .	Lisa Simpson
rocks ... shatter ... jagged cliff ... lis , you 've just given me an idea for the most insane , hair-brained , fool-proof scheme ever !	Bart Simpson
okay . when mom and dad see this dummy fall in the river , they 'll think it 's me , and they 'll realize what really matters : each other .	Bart Simpson
now , to make sure homer and marge are in proper viewing position ...	Bart Simpson
so , i got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize .	Marge Simpson
well , i got your note saying you were gon na bring me a bucket of potato salad .	Homer Simpson
where 's my apology ?	Marge Simpson
where 's my bucket ?	Homer Simpson
now , i 'll get my mom and dad 's attention , and you shove the dummy in the water . any questions ?	Bart Simpson
pile of dog doo . let 's roll .	Bart Simpson
mom , dad ! i 'm playing on a dangerous cliff -- because you 're too busy arguing to pay attention to me !	Bart Simpson
bart ! we 're all disappointed there 's no potato salad ! but for god 's sake , do n't jump !	Homer Simpson
now !	Bart Simpson
i 'm a-comin ' , boy !	Homer Simpson
this is all my fault ! i planted mom 's bra in milhouse 's parents ' bed !	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
homer ! i can save you both ! just let go of the rock !	Marge Simpson
just do it ! trust me !	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
mom ... dad . i 'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together .	Bart Simpson
make it two kajillion .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
we 'll lose the first kajillion to taxes .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess you showed you do trust me after all .	Marge Simpson
of course i do . the only thing i ca n't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me .	Homer Simpson
oh , homie ...	Marge Simpson
hey lis , i bet i could jump in the swimming pool from here .	Bart Simpson
bart , that would be the stupidest thing you ever did .	Lisa Simpson
no , the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards .	Bart Simpson
cowa --	Bart Simpson
uh , mom ? remember how you wished we would never grow up ?	Lisa Simpson
i guess we should count our blessings he 's not dead .	Homer Simpson
bart , wake up . i got that bike you wanted !	Marge Simpson
a robot ?	Marge Simpson
wow . a robot kid would be a blast . we can confuse him and make his head explode . `` this statement is a lie . but if it 's a lie then it must be true . but if it 's true , then it must be ... '' kaboom !	Homer Simpson
i thought he was in a coma !	Marge Simpson
you already said that !	Marge Simpson
okay .	Marge Simpson
oh , he knows how to push all my buttons .	Marge Simpson
time to destroy the one who did this to me .	Bart Simpson
now , i 'm a man who likes to strangle his kids . do you think i could ...	Homer Simpson
why you metal ... !	Homer Simpson
wow , the windpipe is incredibly responsive !	Homer Simpson
david is so helpful ...	Marge Simpson
and he 's great with the neighbors .	Homer Simpson
having a robot brother troubles me . the ethical implications are really tensing me up .	Lisa Simpson
goodbye , implications ...	Lisa Simpson
nice and hot-o , mr. robot-o !	Homer Simpson
david , you 're by far the best son i 've ever had . uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
did you replace me with this tinkertoy ?	Bart Simpson
replace is such an ugly word . we upgraded .	Homer Simpson
eat my shorts .	Bart Simpson
here , make me a kitty !	Homer Simpson
i hate going to the zoo . i feel so sorry for the animals .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals . in the wild they would never experience boredom , obesity , loss of purpose ... you know , the american dream .	Homer Simpson
thank god i landed in a bunch of fruity birds .	Bart Simpson
this is where stem cell research led us !	Bart Simpson
david and bart just are n't working out . we have to do something .	Marge Simpson
i 'm really sorry , but our family just ca n't handle both of you boys . i hope that somewhere deep in your data banks , you process fond memories of us .	Homer Simpson
the sad part is , there were times when i actually had feelings for you . i almost felt i was your father .	Homer Simpson
what are you talking about ?	Bart Simpson
david feels , and your mother will agree when i tell her , that it 's best for our family if you 're no longer in it .	Homer Simpson
we 're still going to the toy store , right ? and i can pick out as many toys as i want ?	Bart Simpson
no toys !	Homer Simpson
there should be a law against abandoning your child ...	Bart Simpson
i 'm not a robot , i 'm human .	Bart Simpson
i said i 'm a human , not a girl .	Bart Simpson
can i stay with you guys tonight ?	Bart Simpson
yeah , maybe . what did you used to do ?	Bart Simpson
i get it , i get it ! sucks to be you . goodnight .	Bart Simpson

you told me he was at culinary school !	Marge Simpson
you wanted to believe the lie !	Homer Simpson
those were my good pants .	Homer Simpson
well , the important thing is we 're a family again .	Marge Simpson
this stinks ! i 've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that 's not equipped for an adult diet .	Homer Simpson
dad ! dad ! wake up ! you 're not a robot !	Lisa Simpson
you 're just possessed by the devil .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll call work and tell them he ca n't make it .	Marge Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
suckers .	Homer Simpson
`` dear homer simpson -- mr. burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate . '' parenthesis , sinister laugh , closed parenthesis .	Marge Simpson
please do n't accept this invitation , dad . hunting is cruel .	Lisa Simpson
honey , animals do n't feel death . that was proved by the scientists at black angus .	Homer Simpson
no fair ! dad gets to kill wild animals , but i shoot one bird and i have to go to a psychiatrist .	Bart Simpson
he still thinks that hobo was a bird .	Marge Simpson
mom , mr. burns is gon na kill dad !	Lisa Simpson
i should 've known something was wrong when we got this week 's tv guide .	Marge Simpson

what do you have against santa ?	Bart Simpson
oh , bart , why 'd you ask him a follow-up question ?	Lisa Simpson

santa must have left it .	Lisa Simpson
christmas is a family day	Marge Simpson
my god ... it 's over ... we 're free !	Homer Simpson
i said we 're free !	Homer Simpson
i hope i never hear that god-awful nutcracker music again .	Homer Simpson

i knew you 'd forget , so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me .	Marge Simpson
oh , it 's just what i wanted . here , marge , this is for you .	Homer Simpson
come on , we 're going to that store ! before the next commercial makes me do something else .	Marge Simpson
i 've never noticed that sign before , and i 'm a very good noticer .	Marge Simpson
they must have just made this a toll road .	Lisa Simpson
they ca n't charge me for something i use every day . what 's next , a spatula tax ?	Marge Simpson
well , what choice do you have ?	Lisa Simpson
voila ! which is french for `` ta da '' !	Marge Simpson
boy , you sure showed them .	Lisa Simpson

my gramma ? i have n't seen her in years . she ran away .	Bart Simpson
hey grampa , we got a letter for gramma .	Bart Simpson
`` my dearest mona . you 've just left my arms to return to your husband , abe , and already i ache for you . ''	Lisa Simpson
lisa , i 'm not sure that letter is `` age appropriate '' reading . why ca n't the government edit our mail like other countries ?	Marge Simpson
uh-oh . `` i know i 'm just a lifeguard , but i want you to run away with me . if you do n't reply to this letter , i 'll know that you 've chosen to stay with abe . but i know in my heart that the baby you 're carrying is mine .	Marge Simpson
love always ... 'm ' . ''	Marge Simpson
homer , that means your dad might not be your dad !	Marge Simpson
i do n't care what that letter said . this man raised me single-handedly . when i think of all the things he 's done for me ... the many times he ...	Homer Simpson
lifeguard , huh ?	Homer Simpson
so this guy might be my real father , and his name starts with `` m '' . moleman ? mr. burns ? m. night shyamalan ? that would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films !	Homer Simpson
yeah , but that also works for the dog 's butt .	Bart Simpson
well , this whole fatherhood issue could be resolved with a simple dna test .	Lisa Simpson
homie , what 's wrong ? did those pork chops give you a tummy ache ?	Marge Simpson
the only tummy ache is in my head . i ca n't stop wondering who my real father might be .	Homer Simpson
there 's only one lifeguard whose name begins with `` m '' !	Homer Simpson
mason fairbanks ...	Homer Simpson
his hobbies are philandering ... writing letters ... and making up for lost time !	Homer Simpson
okay , until you 're sure this guy 's cool , stick to your cover story . oh , that sounds hard . just do it !	Homer Simpson
uh yes , i 'm a reporter with the local paper . i 'm doing a story on people who ... wear sweaters . do you mind if i ask you some questions ?	Homer Simpson
interesting . interesting .	Homer Simpson
so , i infer from all the knickknacks you 're some sort of fruitcake .	Homer Simpson
oh , that is so cool ! ooh , a dish of shrunken heads !	Homer Simpson
so , you do n't have any shrunken heads ?	Homer Simpson
that is small , right ?	Homer Simpson
uh ... you know it 's a boat , right ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name .	Homer Simpson
no ... i said i work for a radio station . nine-eighty on the am dial but number one with our viewers !	Homer Simpson
uh ... well i ... i think you 're my pappy !	Homer Simpson
i found this letter you wrote to my mom , mona simpson .	Homer Simpson
possible daddy !	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry ... i got a little carried away there .	Homer Simpson
marge , i found my real father ! his name is mason fairbanks , he has a knife just for cheese , and he talks like this `` homer , please do that in the loo . ''	Homer Simpson
homie , you just met this british man . it 's too soon to get so emotionally invested .	Marge Simpson
hm , honey , you 've given me a lot to think about ... tomorrow , when we 're on daddy 's boat !	Homer Simpson
mr. fairbanks , lookin ' at your boat i got ta say , gramma bet on the wrong horse .	Bart Simpson
you know , if i was born three months later , emerald would be my birthstone .	Marge Simpson
wow , that story had everything : action , treasure , water , a guy ... would you like to come to our house for dinner ?	Homer Simpson
listen , old-timer , i 'd like you to meet mason fairbanks .	Homer Simpson
mason , come see my room !	Homer Simpson
homer , look what this is doing to grampa . we have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test .	Marge Simpson
grampa , stop .	Lisa Simpson
oh god .	Marge Simpson
who 's mason fairbanks ?	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
see , abe , we 're still visiting you , even though we have no biological obligation .	Marge Simpson
you 've said that three times already !	Bart Simpson
well , then you think of something !	Marge Simpson
no , but he told us to say hi . hi !	Lisa Simpson
so ... what setting is that fan on ?	Lisa Simpson
i would have guessed low .	Lisa Simpson
and my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on .	Homer Simpson
ha-ha ! that 's what you get for being luminous , jerks !	Homer Simpson
hey guys , we found the treasure ! when i get to shore , i 'm bringin ' it right to the bar .	Homer Simpson

oh homie , i always believed you were gon na make it , no matter what that pushy casket salesman said .	Marge Simpson
wait . can we have a moment in private ?	Homer Simpson
of course .	Marge Simpson
as i lay dying on the ocean floor , i remembered everything you 've done for me . to hell with that stupid dna test and its ninety-nine point nine , nine , nine , nine , seven per cent accuracy -- you 're my dad , and i love you .	Homer Simpson
but how ?	Homer Simpson
only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else .	Homer Simpson
aw , dad .	Homer Simpson
now , why do n't you stay for dinner .	Homer Simpson
send up two hams !	Homer Simpson
hey , this one 's cold !	Homer Simpson

you made that tv show really mad .	Homer Simpson
upward bound : the toughest behavioral modification camp in northwest oregon .	Marge Simpson

hey guys , i have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp , then i 'll be back to go to vegas !	Homer Simpson
dad , if you take me to vegas , i 'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack .	Bart Simpson
boy , you do n't need to cheat when you got a system .	Homer Simpson
what 's your system ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't tell your mother how much i 've lost .	Homer Simpson
one child to portland ! he 's your problem now .	Homer Simpson
why , there must be some mistake .	Homer Simpson
nobody tells bart simpson what to do .	Bart Simpson
well homer , looks like i ca n't go to discipline camp . which is too bad , 'cause i think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ? ! you 're going to that camp , 'cause i 'm gon na drive you there .	Homer Simpson
yeah , that 'll be way more fun than vegas .	Bart Simpson
stupid bart ... makes me drive to oregon ... home of unspoiled forests ... birthplace of matt groening ...	Homer Simpson
dad , neither of us wan na go . why are you doing this ? where 's the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose ?	Bart Simpson
you mean fun homer ? i 'm afraid serious homer has him locked up till you 're at your snooty torture camp .	Homer Simpson
fight back , fun homer ! together we can win !	Bart Simpson
it 's no use .	Homer Simpson
while the boys are gone , we 'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios .	Marge Simpson
i already made up a yard-sale sign !	Lisa Simpson
you know , your father saved every book report he ever wrote . and every one was stuart little !	Marge Simpson
not to mention this power point demonstration he did just last week .	Marge Simpson
my malibu stacy heads !	Lisa Simpson
oh no , bart blamed this on the dog ! i did n't pet him for weeks ! oh , i 'm sorry i doubted you , boy .	Lisa Simpson
eh .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , dad , we got a long way to go . you ca n't stay mad at me the whole time .	Bart Simpson
boy , if you were half as smart as you think you are , you 'd clean up your act .	Homer Simpson
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i 'm good at .	Bart Simpson
at least you have something you 're good at . i 'm thirty-eight years old , drivin ' a crappy car , with a son who does n't respect me , and i 'm one snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes . mmm , snickers pie .	Homer Simpson
so , i see you 're also traveling with your son . what boy prison are you taking him to ?	Homer Simpson
see bart , i told you things could be worse .	Homer Simpson
did you see that ? they were eating melon for breakfast !	Bart Simpson
look at me , i use a napkin .	Homer Simpson
well dad , we may not always get along , but we 'll never be that lame .	Bart Simpson
i bet they 're from massachusetts . you know , it 's legal there for a guy to marry his son .	Homer Simpson
well , i guess it 's tinkle time .	Bart Simpson
do n't forget to wash your hands , shakespeare .	Homer Simpson
yeah , i 'll have the smiley-face breakfast special .	Homer Simpson
uh , but could you add a bacon nose ? plus bacon hair , bacon mustache , five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits ... and a bacon body .	Homer Simpson
fine . but the bacon man lives in a bacon house !	Homer Simpson
you know who would really like this place ? bart . wait a minute ... where the hell is bart ?	Homer Simpson
you little monster ! show your face this minute !	Homer Simpson

my yard sale is a failure . i guess i 'll have to give everything to the salvation army .	Marge Simpson
i guess -- they 're homer 's expired pain medications .	Marge Simpson

you sweet little angel . oh , i 'm gon na rip your head off . and spit down your adorable little neck . because i wan na smash your little stupid head . oh , but i love you we 'll go on a fishing trip . but first i 'm gon na put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out . that 's what i 'm gon na do !	Homer Simpson

oh . chief wiggum . uh , are you still with the police department ?	Marge Simpson
well boy , you made the right choice . i think this is the first step to a new , closer relationship between us .	Homer Simpson
dad , i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer .	Bart Simpson
i do n't enjoy it . being a father is just a job . long hours , no pay , and at the end , all you get is someone yelling `` you screwed me up '' !	Homer Simpson
well , maybe if you enjoyed me more , i would n't be so screwed up .	Bart Simpson
hey , i enjoy you plenty .	Homer Simpson
talking time is over .	Homer Simpson
thank you , colonel .	Homer Simpson

homer , i hope you get this . i 'm in jail and i need ten thousand dollars bail . hurry !	Marge Simpson
uh , marge . me and bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss , and now we 're in nevada state prison . also , i do n't know where bart is . if you see him , say `` hey . ''	Homer Simpson
well maggie , i always knew it would some day boil down to just you and me . i 'll look for work in the morning .	Lisa Simpson
i caught it ! i 'm safe !	Bart Simpson

sweetie , if someone 's bullying you , you should tell your teacher .	Marge Simpson
but it 's the teacher who 's bullying me .	Bart Simpson
well , tell your regular bully . he wo n't like it one bit .	Marge Simpson

bombardment . bombardment . how do you like bombardment ? i 'll show him .	Bart Simpson
time for the bombarded to become the bombardier .	Bart Simpson

oh yeah , that 's why .	Bart Simpson
you 're a jerk ! i 'm telling mom !	Lisa Simpson
hee-eere .	Bart Simpson
kid power !	Bart Simpson
listen , i 'm real sorry i busted your shack . let me make it up to you . i know a ravine where there 's a rusted-out car .	Bart Simpson
that 's my mom , i got ta go . i finished nailing this board .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah , you 're out of nails .	Bart Simpson
poor willie . would you like to spend the night with us ?	Marge Simpson
that 's not a pan , it 's a colander !	Marge Simpson
uh ... ooh , ooh , it 's lovely . i like this part in here ... the way it , um , it goes .	Marge Simpson
willie ? i hope i 'm not being too personal , but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor .	Lisa Simpson
do n't you ever hope for anything better ?	Lisa Simpson
and ... ?	Lisa Simpson
maybe you could aim a little higher .	Bart Simpson
oh , would n't it be adequate ?	Homer Simpson
adequate ... adequate ...	Lisa Simpson
hey , that 's great . g'night .	Bart Simpson
bart ! willie could have a better life ! if only someone showed him how ...	Lisa Simpson
i bet i could turn him into a proper gentleman ! and i will do it in time for the school science fair !	Lisa Simpson
you 're on , lis .	Bart Simpson
i think you 'll find that deep down , anyone can be civilized . goodnight , willie .	Lisa Simpson
willie , in the next few weeks i 'll be teaching you poise , pronunciation and posture . let 's see you stand up as straight as you can .	Lisa Simpson
mr. stern , would you make those glorious blue pants again if i whipped up public interest for them ?	Homer Simpson
through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting , i have n't even thought of it yet .	Homer Simpson
how long is this commercial anyway ?	Homer Simpson
okay . how do you address an archbishop ?	Lisa Simpson
homie , what 's that ?	Marge Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
on the back of your head .	Marge Simpson
it 's called `` headvertising . '' it creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media .	Homer Simpson
well , it creeps me out !	Marge Simpson
wow , it glows in the dark .	Marge Simpson
it 's not supposed to .	Homer Simpson
alright , let 's just try one more lesson . repeat after me : `` what flows from the nose does not go on the clothes . ''	Lisa Simpson
care to concede that bet ?	Bart Simpson
no ! c'mon , willie . i believe in you !	Lisa Simpson
say it again !	Lisa Simpson
i think he 's got it ! oh yes he 's got it !	Lisa Simpson
where is that ghastly flow ?	Lisa Simpson
and where should it not go ?	Lisa Simpson

that 's where you 're wrong , principal skinner . i did enter a project ... and it 's been in plain sight the entire evening !	Lisa Simpson

hm ... maybe there 's room on my sports wall .	Lisa Simpson
now you have a friend .	Lisa Simpson
willie , there are no more lessons . you 're a proper gentleman , my work is done .	Lisa Simpson
and that job 's taken . skinner dumped it on the next-lowest guy on the totem pole .	Bart Simpson
i think this is the perfect job for the new you , willie . it requires sophistication , tact , and you get to meet the highest class of people .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head .	Marge Simpson
well , it did its job . everyone 's wearing blue pants now .	Homer Simpson
i 'd like to get into some blue pants right now .	Marge Simpson

so , how you doin ' , willie ?	Lisa Simpson

we could n't find a way out .	Marge Simpson
but on the upside , i found some cave paintings and made them awesome .	Bart Simpson
boy , come here and listen to lisa 's story . it 's about moe 's treasure !	Homer Simpson
so , to contin-	Lisa Simpson
hey moe ! thanks to you , i 've been sober a week !	Homer Simpson
i 've got detention all summer .	Bart Simpson
because i 'm a screw-up . my sister 's the smart one -- all i do is get in trouble .	Bart Simpson
oh , it does n't matter . everyone 's pretty much given up on me . i bet i wo n't even make it through fourth grade .	Bart Simpson
wait , wait , wait , there 's one thing i do n't understand here .	Marge Simpson
you never had detention all summer .	Marge Simpson
oh , that load of crap ? no , i was just keepin ' her busy while nelson stole microscopes . make with the story .	Bart Simpson
well , my best recollection of burns ' paraphrasing of what he read in moe 's letter is that krabappel told moe ...	Lisa Simpson
you did n't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole .	Homer Simpson
my pearl necklace ! i must have lost it , and you were just bringing it back to me .	Lisa Simpson
how did you find this ?	Lisa Simpson
i want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me !	Lisa Simpson
mr. burns got his plant back , and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul .	Lisa Simpson
aw dad , did my story make you cry ?	Lisa Simpson
well , it was very moving , but the thing is , bats are chewing my legs !	Homer Simpson
oh , why did i lead you down here to find those stupid coins ?	Homer Simpson
huh ? / you knew about the coins ? / the coins are down here ? / etc .	Marge Simpson
homer , you brought us to this horrible place on purpose ?	Marge Simpson
that was the most horrible part of all !	Marge Simpson
well , i guess i should explain . not long ago , it was my day to take care of the baby , so i was out in the forest , hiding .	Homer Simpson
i deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave .	Homer Simpson
i figured he 'd never miss two or three pieces . money which we could use to pay for bart 's operation .	Homer Simpson
i need an operation ?	Bart Simpson
that 's a story for another day .	Homer Simpson
i realized i could never find the gold without your help . so i made it this week 's family outing .	Homer Simpson
how can you take it ? we have n't found it .	Marge Simpson
oh ...	Marge Simpson
if you all do n't drop your guns and behave , no one gets the gold .	Marge Simpson
and why do you really want it , anyway ? moe , will the gold bring back edna 's love ?	Marge Simpson
mr. burns , is n't it more important that you got a child to smile at you ?	Marge Simpson
i can see there 's only one way to turn you into human beings again .	Marge Simpson
and that 's why i did n't have time to study for my geography test .	Bart Simpson
why does god always need money ?	Bart Simpson
it 's a lot of little stuff . god has to pay all the elves in his workshop ... plus he 's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave saturn ?	Homer Simpson
and how . but this is different .	Marge Simpson
reverend , why do we really need this ?	Marge Simpson
oh , that 's the new `` femac '' ! the computer designed just for women ! the `` you 've got mail '' voice is susan sarandon !	Marge Simpson

hey ... that 's the same thing you said to bart after he choked in that soccer game . and we both know he sucked .	Homer Simpson
just put it in the trunk and leave .	Homer Simpson
ned , that 's so generous . but there must be something i could do in return .	Marge Simpson
... uh , hmm , let 's see , uh just a second uhh ... oh , yeah sure , i 'd be happy to baby-sit for rod and todd .	Marge Simpson
no rudner .	Marge Simpson

old man flanders !	Homer Simpson
springfield high football rules !	Homer Simpson

help ! she 's grooming me ! she 's grooming me !	Bart Simpson
are n't you gon na do something ?	Homer Simpson
but she 'll leave the rest of him alone ?	Homer Simpson
ned , i know you like to worry , but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves .	Marge Simpson
i thought they might enjoy it if i took them here .	Marge Simpson
everything 's covered in foam . and it 's owned by a corporation , so you know it 's safe .	Marge Simpson
where 's bart ? i have n't seen him since you came home .	Marge Simpson
oh , you have n't seen bart for a few hours , so you automatically assume i let something terrible happen .	Homer Simpson
i did n't say that .	Marge Simpson
i know what you think : when stupid homer was n't looking , bart got kidnapped by a monkey .	Homer Simpson
i could never think something that horrible .	Marge Simpson
and now i 'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing , so later i can say that i already told you .	Homer Simpson
sorry i asked .	Marge Simpson
dad , you ca n't keep this up for long .	Lisa Simpson
oh , you 're so right . i guess i should be more concerned with bart 's safety than covering my own butt . and maybe i 'm talking like this because i ca n't stop . help me , lisa ! i have serious mental problems !	Homer Simpson
look , it 's been fun and all , but i miss indoor plumbing .	Bart Simpson
sorry , lady . i 've never eaten fresh fruit and i reckon i never will .	Bart Simpson
whoa ! this oreo is rank .	Bart Simpson

i 'm sorry , ned . i never thought this would happen .	Marge Simpson
i am not an unfit mother !	Marge Simpson
hey monkey , eat tranquilizer dart !	Homer Simpson
maybe there 's another way to solve this . bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toot-toot .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , monkeys do n't have feelings . if they did , then my experiments could be called cruel .	Homer Simpson
toot-toot ! look ! i 'm using this rock as a tool !	Bart Simpson
ow !	Bart Simpson
she 's kissing his boo-boo ! that 's it , i 'm going in .	Marge Simpson
excuse me , mrs. toot , i need to talk to you mother to mother .	Marge Simpson
while you were living the glamorous life of a tv chimp , i was raising my son . you have no right to take him away from me now . please , please , give me back my boy .	Marge Simpson
marge , toot-toot and her son escaped !	Homer Simpson
hey , i know how we can save bart .	Lisa Simpson
mr . teeny ? !	Homer Simpson
he also happens to be toot-toot 's son .	Lisa Simpson
nelson , funny town does n't exist .	Lisa Simpson
listen , we can trade mr. teeny for bart . we just have to find a way to get him up there .	Lisa Simpson
ned ... rod needs to know you believe he can be okay on his own .	Marge Simpson
you 'd be surprised what he could do if you just gave him a chance .	Marge Simpson
okay , but do n't let our hands touch . it 's gay .	Bart Simpson
um ... it means you used to be afraid , but now you 're not .	Bart Simpson
i believe he 's saying he 's okay .	Marge Simpson
i am so stoked about lenny 's party . he said he 's gon na make a surprise announcement !	Homer Simpson

when i was in school , i loved math . until ...	Marge Simpson

you 'd do that for me ? that is so sweet .	Lisa Simpson
you 're a boy -- nothing is sweet .	Bart Simpson
ow , that hurt .	Lisa Simpson

that 's right , everyone . the best math student in the whole school is a girl !	Lisa Simpson
wait a minute -- do you know why you did good at math ?	Bart Simpson
the only reason lisa won is because she learned to think like a boy ! i turned her into a burping , farting , bullying , math machine !	Bart Simpson
that 's a lie !	Lisa Simpson
goodbye , mr. simpson .	Marge Simpson
i always thought that boys had it easier . but now i see their world is more cruel and sadistic than i ever imagined .	Lisa Simpson
and i did get better at math , but it was only by abandoning everything i believed in . i guess the real reason we do n't see many women in math and science is ...	Lisa Simpson
well , whatever the answer is , i 'm glad i 'm a girl and i 'm glad i 'm good at math . now enjoy your stupid flautist .	Lisa Simpson
duh ! nobody wants their address painted on the curb . we do it without asking , and then they have to pay .	Bart Simpson
that 's honest work for honest pay !	Bart Simpson
screw you ! i 'm never gon na pay !	Homer Simpson

`` a highly skilled professional will come to your home , and clean it top to bottom while you relax . '' but how could i have won ? i do n't subscribe to this periodical .	Marge Simpson
marge , i do n't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people 's mail .	Homer Simpson
mom , what are you doing ?	Lisa Simpson
cleaning up before the housekeeper comes .	Marge Simpson
this is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living . who cares what she thinks ?	Lisa Simpson

i 'm your husband !	Homer Simpson
wha -- ? !	Marge Simpson
i am ! we 're the same age !	Homer Simpson
but you 're so much more ... ravaged than i am .	Marge Simpson
i do eat a lot of crap .	Homer Simpson
i 'm lisa , i 'm eight years old , and this might sound presumptuous , but -- i 'm your favorite .	Lisa Simpson
oh , you seem sweet , but i could never have a favorite .	Marge Simpson
well , talk to me in a week .	Lisa Simpson
hi , i 'm bart . i 'm ten years old and a professional moto-cross jumper . can you buy me a moto-cross bike ?	Bart Simpson
i may have lost my memory , but i 'm not an idiot .	Marge Simpson
great news , marge -- we 're goin ' home .	Homer Simpson
ooh , i ca n't wait to see what kind of home we live in .	Marge Simpson
oh it 's great . like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke .	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
you strangle your child ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , but he 's cool with it . right ?	Homer Simpson
it hurts when i swallow .	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory .	Homer Simpson
who are those freaks ?	Marge Simpson
those `` freaks , '' as you call them , are some of our closest friends .	Homer Simpson
why is that drug addict driving a school bus ?	Marge Simpson
see that ball of fire ? that 's the sun . it goes by many names : apollo 's lantern , day-moon , old blazey . the important thing is never to touch it .	Homer Simpson
i know what the sun is .	Marge Simpson
yes , now you do .	Homer Simpson
i know that sound !	Marge Simpson
maggie ! my sweet little angel !	Marge Simpson
the sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in mom 's brain .	Lisa Simpson
lisa ! my little know-it-all !	Marge Simpson
milhouse ! you 're bart 's best friend !	Marge Simpson
i remember bart !	Marge Simpson
i ca n't believe you remembered me through milhouse . he 's not even my best friend .	Bart Simpson
it 's so great to have my children back .	Marge Simpson
i 'd better get ready -- i 'm next !	Homer Simpson
all right , marge ... time to remember admiral awesome !	Homer Simpson
nope . i 'm sorry , admiral , but you 're still a stranger to me .	Marge Simpson
why do you remember them and not me ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't know . maybe there 's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you .	Marge Simpson
oh , hey ned ! is n't today your cat 's birthday ? i remember 'cause she shares the date with patty labelle !	Marge Simpson
okay . all it 'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past .	Homer Simpson
here 's me fighting with former president bush , me fighting with current president bush , and here 's me showing a bag of apples who 's boss .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry . you seem like ... a colorful character , but i just do n't remember you .	Marge Simpson
well , maybe if we snuggle , it might rattle some memories loose .	Homer Simpson
what 's snuggling ?	Marge Simpson
when a man and a woman love each other very much , they --	Homer Simpson
mr. simpson , i do n't even know you -- i 'm not making love with you !	Marge Simpson
but what if we ...	Homer Simpson
you 're describing how to parallel park .	Marge Simpson
you used to love my non sequiturs !	Homer Simpson
why can i remember everyone in town except my husband ?	Marge Simpson
have you been talking like this for my entire marriage ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't know . i should give homer a chance ... but on the other hand , i feel nothing for him .	Marge Simpson
this is horrible .	Lisa Simpson
we 've got to tell dad !	Bart Simpson
oh no , bart and lisa are gon na tell me something horrible !	Homer Simpson
mr. simpson ?	Marge Simpson
marge , if i ca n't make you remember me , then i 'll make you fall for me all over again .	Homer Simpson
the heart is the symbol for love .	Homer Simpson
so beautiful . i wish i could understand italian .	Homer Simpson
i 've had a lovely evening , mr. simpson .	Marge Simpson
just wait . we 're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever !	Homer Simpson
it was in that plywood castle that we first ... well , you know ...	Homer Simpson

no ! i 'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course !	Marge Simpson
oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but .	Homer Simpson
that sounds horrible !	Marge Simpson
no , it was the happiest night of my life ! the warm spring air , the swings i took in the batting cage afterwards ... do n't you remember , darling ?	Homer Simpson
no ! and i hope i never do ! the best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you !	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry you have to leave . but i just ca n't think of another way .	Marge Simpson
i know . wait , i thought of another way : i stay !	Homer Simpson
dad , we do n't want you to leave !	Lisa Simpson

look at this garden of f 's . you planted them all !	Bart Simpson
marge , i realize you 've made up your mind , and i want you to know that i deeply respect your boo !	Homer Simpson
that works for hiccups , not amnesia .	Marge Simpson
i know . i just thought maybe ... boo !	Homer Simpson
boo .	Homer Simpson
well , the rest of your life for sure .	Homer Simpson

at least she 's found someone who can make her happy .	Homer Simpson
you really mean that ?	Marge Simpson
i 've got amnesia and i have three kids .	Marge Simpson
you idiot !	Homer Simpson
do you know what you just gave up ? !	Homer Simpson
the wisest , wettest man you 'll ever meet .	Homer Simpson
you just walked away from the sweetest , most beautiful woman a guy could want . in ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she 's never complained . every election , she wishes she could vote for both guys , because they both seem nice . and there 's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better . and you blew her off .	Homer Simpson
really ? well she 's still great !	Homer Simpson
mr. simpson ?	Marge Simpson
i may not know much about you , but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me . and that means a lot to a woman .	Marge Simpson
i still do n't remember you , but for the first time since this happened , i wish i did ... homer .	Marge Simpson
i 'm so happy we 're together again . wan na get a drink ?	Homer Simpson
you drink ?	Marge Simpson
uh , yeah . i started when you were in the hospital . i was so worried . recently i tried this thing called `` beer . '' and ...	Homer Simpson
i remember everything -- you get drunk all the time !	Marge Simpson
but do you also remember that you 're an enabler ?	Homer Simpson
oh of course i do ! that 's why we 're such a great team !	Marge Simpson
oh , i do n't ...	Marge Simpson

wow , she still works here ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , she 's over in post now .	Homer Simpson
oh , i always liked that guy !	Marge Simpson
not me -- but we ca n't get rid of him , 'cause he 's friends with richard sakai .	Homer Simpson
oh , and there 's a familiar name . and another one . wait , what-what ever happened to that guy from the network ? did he get married ?	Marge Simpson
oh , he ai n't gettin ' married . he has commitment issues !	Homer Simpson
school ? oh my god , i 've wasted the whole summer . there 's so many things i still wan na do .	Bart Simpson
i 've got to squeeze a whole summer of carefree fun into one day .	Bart Simpson
win baseball game .	Bart Simpson

appear in summer stock play ...	Bart Simpson
sit on it , springfield ! yeah !	Bart Simpson
summer blockbuster ...	Bart Simpson
oh ... so that 's why everyone 's been sayin ' that all summer .	Bart Simpson

i 'll never forget you .	Bart Simpson

i just had my first kiss .	Bart Simpson
when you get to third base , i 'll buy ya a beer .	Homer Simpson
well , now it 's time for my summer activity . you promised we could go to a museum .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so glad you picked the museum of natural history , mom .	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm so glad there 's a show we women can enjoy !	Marge Simpson
weaving ? !	Bart Simpson
homer , you 're my father , you 're supposed to protect me from things like this !	Bart Simpson
all right . just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle .	Homer Simpson
what ? !	Marge Simpson
woo-hoo ! weapons !	Homer Simpson
bart , it 's still history .	Lisa Simpson

die , weapons , die !	Bart Simpson
do n't start the exhibit without me !	Homer Simpson
look at that line .	Homer Simpson
time to do what i do best -- ruin it for everybody .	Homer Simpson
hey , flanders ! thanks for saving our place .	Homer Simpson
aw dude , i was totally here . you calling me a liar ? in front of my kids ? 'cause i 'd take a bullet for you , man . right in my mouth !	Homer Simpson
oh , no you do n't !	Homer Simpson
i 'm everywhere .	Homer Simpson
wow , this 3-d is amazing ! you can actually feel the vase !	Homer Simpson
go ahead , maggie . you 're allowed to touch the deadly weapons .	Marge Simpson
ooh , it 's a mugger ! i 'll hand over all my hugs and kisses !	Marge Simpson
okay , be cool . i 've got some candy in my purse ...	Marge Simpson
c'mon , milhouse . do you wan na play in the nba or not ?	Bart Simpson
that means it 's working .	Bart Simpson
sorry , flanders . but when you get in , you can use my audio tour . narrated by melanie griffith .	Homer Simpson
creationism ? but that 's not science .	Lisa Simpson
how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory ?	Lisa Simpson
this is slander ! darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time !	Lisa Simpson
evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact . it 's even accepted by prominent conservatives , like george will and the late pope john paul !	Lisa Simpson
all i 'm saying is --	Lisa Simpson
what 's wrong , sweetie ?	Marge Simpson
they 're making us learn creation theory in school . today we had a test , and every answer was `` god did it . ''	Lisa Simpson
well , i think it 's good to give both ideas a fair hearing . maybe they could learn from each other .	Marge Simpson
but they 're incompatible !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , lots of times two incompatible things can both be true . my son 's a brat but he 's a special little guy . your father says he 's at work , but there he is jumping on a trampoline .	Marge Simpson
mom , you really have to choose here , between science and belief .	Lisa Simpson
well then i choose ... uh ...	Marge Simpson
so , according to creationism , there were no cavemen .	Bart Simpson
good riddance . their drawings suck and they look like hippies .	Homer Simpson
dad , you 're not really reconsidering evolution , are you ?	Lisa Simpson
my mind is always open to new ideas .	Homer Simpson
onions in the peas ! what the hell ?	Homer Simpson
i have an issue i 'd like to raise !	Lisa Simpson
last week , the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools .	Lisa Simpson
evolution and creationism can not co-exist , people . it is time to go back to teaching one single truth !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so glad you could all come . i 'll be reading to you from `` the origin of species '' by charles darwin .	Lisa Simpson
chapter one : when we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals ...	Lisa Simpson
there are so many worse crimes . why are you persecuting me ?	Lisa Simpson
this is the break in the case we 've been waiting for !	Homer Simpson
poor bambi ... poor thumper ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , mom . i should have just gone with the flow like you said .	Lisa Simpson
well , i might as well see what all the fuss is about .	Marge Simpson
homer , please .	Marge Simpson
i love it when you 're not into it . oh yeah , baby . oh yeah that 's it ignore me . i 'm not even here .	Homer Simpson
wow , darwin 's argument is incredibly persuasive . and his ship was the beagle , which reminds me of snoopy ... my favorite peanut !	Marge Simpson
lisa , i think i have a way to help you at the trial today .	Marge Simpson
so do i !	Bart Simpson
milhouse will serve the time for you while you flee to mexico . your new name : seã±orita ugly .	Bart Simpson
honey , i appreciate the thought , but just leave everything to me .	Marge Simpson
you can take off the wig , milhouse .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry lisa , i 've got the answer to your problems right here .	Marge Simpson
look , homie , i brought you a beer .	Marge Simpson
thanks , marge . it 's not a twist-off !	Homer Simpson
c'mon ...	Homer Simpson
c'mon ! open ! i want what 's in you !	Homer Simpson
you , stupid ...	Homer Simpson
oh wait , it was a twist-off .	Homer Simpson
thanks , mom .	Lisa Simpson
thank you , honey , for opening my eyes .	Marge Simpson
i ca n't wait to see what evolution will make next : maybe a bird with a people face , or a bear with pants on !	Marge Simpson
mr. flanders , wait !	Lisa Simpson
i want you to know , i respect your beliefs and i can see how deeply you feel about them .	Lisa Simpson
i just do n't think religion should be taught in our schools , any more than you 'd want scientists teaching at the church .	Lisa Simpson
it 's amazing they 've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise .	Lisa Simpson
remember when we saw hunch 's butt in the shower ?	Bart Simpson
that was two seasons ago !	Marge Simpson
now you can only see butts on cable .	Homer Simpson
the isotopes are winning ? to the bandwagon !	Homer Simpson

season tickets ? ! i could entertain business clients . i might even land the henderson account !	Homer Simpson
homer , can i see you in the kitchen ?	Marge Simpson
sure . that means she wants to talk in private . it 's probably about you .	Homer Simpson
homie , i do n't think our marriage is so jim dandy that we should be counseling others .	Marge Simpson
hey , we 've gone through more hardships than the jews and charlie brown put together .	Homer Simpson
well , we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life .	Marge Simpson
that 's just how i feel .	Homer Simpson
buck mitchell !	Homer Simpson
buck , i guess we can help you out . we 'll start tomorrow !	Marge Simpson
buck , tabitha , welcome . we 'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here .	Marge Simpson

wow , i think we 've really hit on something here . unfortunately , we 're out of time . how does that make you feel ?	Homer Simpson
shut up , my ten o'clock 's here .	Homer Simpson

uh , let 's see here ... ooh , here 's something the book 's previous owner underlined ! `` be honest with your partner about what you 're feeling . ''	Marge Simpson
hmmm ... try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way . ''	Marge Simpson
interesting , interesting ... .	Homer Simpson
buck , you 've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about , even while making love to his own marge .	Homer Simpson
maybe we should stop here .	Marge Simpson
good idea , honey . buck , would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy ?	Homer Simpson
just sign your name above president lincoln 's .	Homer Simpson
is n't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice ? they 're always fighting -- if you listen closely , you can hear them arguing right now .	Lisa Simpson
and i say a monkey can mow our lawn !	Homer Simpson
this house is spectacular . you must have had a great view of the riots !	Marge Simpson

or take the same limo .	Marge Simpson
like i always say : compromise is the key .	Homer Simpson
i always say that .	Marge Simpson
let 's compromise and say nobody said it .	Homer Simpson
wow . i 've got this sudden urge to give her a five dollar bill .	Bart Simpson
that 's it ! we 're outta here .	Marge Simpson
hey tabitha , great show . i like that part where you mentioned springfield . did you know that 's where you are ?	Homer Simpson
oh , you 're so hot .	Homer Simpson

oh yeah ...	Homer Simpson
thank god i brought protection .	Homer Simpson
i used to be so embarrassed buying these .	Homer Simpson
oh , we 're gon na have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock .	Homer Simpson
cancellations require twenty-four hours no-tice .	Homer Simpson
dad , because you and mom screwed up buck mitchell 's marriage , some kids beat me up at school today .	Bart Simpson
yeah , they beat me up at work . look at the word they wrote on my skull .	Homer Simpson
oh , papa .	Bart Simpson
i did n't want you to learn that word this way .	Homer Simpson
marge , we 've got ta get buck and tabitha back together . this is the most important case of our careers !	Homer Simpson
listen , bub . we are out of the marriage counseling business . and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me . but not me , 'cause i think they 're disgusting .	Marge Simpson
oh , so now we 're judging each other based on things we 've done . real fair . class act .	Homer Simpson
i 'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together . and i 'll do it with or without you !	Homer Simpson
then i guess you 'll do it without me .	Marge Simpson
but i wanted to do it with you .	Homer Simpson
crossed arms mean `` no . ''	Marge Simpson
tabitha , what a coincidence -- i was just thinking sad thoughts about you !	Marge Simpson
what ? no ! no ! what ? no ! what ?	Marge Simpson
do n't give up on buck . there must be something about him that attracted you in the first place .	Marge Simpson
cancel all my appointments .	Bart Simpson
let 's go .	Marge Simpson
it 's working ! buck 's buying my fake message ! and you said it would never work .	Homer Simpson
uh ... she was here a minute ago . she must be pooping .	Homer Simpson
leave him alone !	Marge Simpson
all he did was try to help a young couple find their way . does he really deserve to get strung up for that ?	Marge Simpson
cut that out !	Marge Simpson
were n't you just tied up in the blimp ?	Marge Simpson
marriage is hard work . but it 's worth it -- when you 've got someone wonderful like i do .	Marge Simpson
great . but enough of the baseball analogies . they sicken me .	Homer Simpson
now , m'lady , your carriage awaits .	Homer Simpson
otto , help me !	Lisa Simpson

mild-mild-mild-mild-mild !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , you 've got to be more careful ! i need you to teach me all about the world of juzz .	Bart Simpson
it 's jazz ! jazz ! you do n't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me !	Lisa Simpson
i always wanted a jazz nickname !	Lisa Simpson
that is the most unfair ...	Lisa Simpson

it 's mergatronic , daddy-ho .	Bart Simpson
bart , does that even mean anything ?	Lisa Simpson

if we ca n't find a home for those animals , they 'll be put to sleep . your sister 's very upset .	Marge Simpson
i feel weird . it 's like a potato chip full of shame , going down my throat sideways .	Bart Simpson
honey , what you 're feeling is called `` empathy . ''	Marge Simpson
now i 'm gon na learn a new word .	Bart Simpson
empathy means you 're looking at lisa , and feeling what she feels . your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz . and now ...	Marge Simpson
how can i end this torture ? !	Bart Simpson
you could do something nice for lisa .	Marge Simpson
you 're my mother ! how can you say that ?	Bart Simpson
good morn-ing .	Bart Simpson
ow !	Bart Simpson
i wan na thank everyone for this special night . jazz folk may have the smallest apartments , but they also have the biggest hearts .	Bart Simpson
but the biggest heart i know is in my sister lisa .	Bart Simpson
lis , you poured your heart into rescuing society 's most vulnerable critters : animals . so i want all the money we 've raised tonight to go to building ... the lisa simpson home for abandoned animals !	Bart Simpson
oh , bart , thank you so , so much !	Lisa Simpson
this place is looking a little run down .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , has n't been the same since they murdered the mayor 's dad here .	Bart Simpson
ooh ! a j.c. penney 's ... used to be here .	Marge Simpson
now it 's a collection of candle kiosks and persian cd stores .	Lisa Simpson
i guess .	Homer Simpson
deal !	Homer Simpson
these games are so old . who got these high scores ? pilgrims ? hmm , never saw this one before .	Bart Simpson
what 's going on here ? am i destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them ? what does this button do ? now my ship is pooping more triangles !	Bart Simpson
oh no , i won a free game !	Bart Simpson
ooh , gummy worms !	Homer Simpson
do n't tell me how many times to think !	Homer Simpson
you are not bringing that thing home .	Marge Simpson
then stand back !	Homer Simpson
this does n't taste like i thought it would .	Homer Simpson
well , if you 're through , let 's check out that discount book warehouse .	Marge Simpson

`` wisconsin from above , '' `` veterans ' day parades , '' ooh , `` smiles of ireland '' ! redheaded twins ? their mother must have her hands full !	Marge Simpson
cool , a carpenter 's library !	Homer Simpson
this does n't look easy , but i 'll bet it is .	Homer Simpson
well , i like the idea of you as a handyman ... and i love the idea of you reading !	Marge Simpson
oh yeah ? blah blah blah blah , blah blah blah blah blah ...	Homer Simpson
blah blah blah , blah blah blah ...	Homer Simpson
okay , now you do me .	Homer Simpson
i never wan na go back to that mall . there were eels in the photo booth !	Lisa Simpson
ew .	Bart Simpson
bart , here 's a letter from your school !	Marge Simpson
a fire ? ! i did n't start a fire in the teachers ' lounge ! i mean , what fire ? i mean , a letter from school ? please elaborate .	Bart Simpson
someone at your school has a life-threatening peanut allergy .	Marge Simpson
the letter does n't say . but from now on , no peanut products are allowed on school property .	Marge Simpson
let 's see what you 've got ... peanut butter and jelly sandwich , trail mix -- starring peanuts , good grief ! more peanuts !	Marge Simpson
homie , do n't you want to build something with your new fix-it books ?	Marge Simpson
i did ! i made a foot rest .	Homer Simpson
do n't you have any follow-through on anything ?	Marge Simpson
what 's the point ? we 're all slowly dying .	Homer Simpson
oh , the floorboard broke my nightstand .	Marge Simpson
i did it ! what 's that strange feeling ? it 's `` of accomplishment '' !	Marge Simpson
wow mom , you made all this ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's like you 're the jesus of carpentry .	Bart Simpson
aww , what a sweet blasphemy .	Marge Simpson
this is a valuable skill . people might even pay you to build things for them .	Lisa Simpson
i could start my own carpentry business . i 'm already arranging the clip art for the letterhead in my mind .	Marge Simpson
perfect !	Marge Simpson
i 'm here to fix your bookcase . you answered my flyer .	Marge Simpson
that 's right .	Marge Simpson
it 's so unfair -- i 'm as handy as any man .	Marge Simpson
you sure are , sweetie -- i love this bed you made .	Homer Simpson
i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing .	Marge Simpson
homer , your butt just gave me a brilliant idea !	Marge Simpson
yep , it 'll do that .	Homer Simpson
simpsons manly-man handyman at your service .	Homer Simpson
no problem . why do n't you go inside and stir your flubber while i get to work .	Homer Simpson
marge , the coast is clear .	Homer Simpson
oh , uh , that was me . you know that old saying : `` measure like a girl , hammer like a guy . ''	Homer Simpson
oh , uh ... you know what they say , `` hammer with the wood and it 's all good . ''	Homer Simpson
it 's allll good .	Homer Simpson
a dash of glue , a turn of screw , and a gazebo 's built that 's perfect for two -- or more !	Marge Simpson
uh-oh , switch !	Marge Simpson
... annnd done .	Homer Simpson
listen ... what would you say if i told you a woman did most of the work ?	Homer Simpson
uh ... like all manly men , i have a vivid imagination .	Homer Simpson
mmm ... extra-virgin ...	Homer Simpson
why should we have to give up our salty snacks , just to keep one allergic kid from exploding ? ! who is this selfish jerk anyway ?	Bart Simpson
willie , you can tell me : who 's the mystery wuss who ca n't eat peanuts ?	Bart Simpson
`` his , '' eh ? hmm , so it 's a dude .	Bart Simpson
hmmm .	Bart Simpson
i help more than you might think .	Marge Simpson
of course i can make a credenza , whatever that is . just give all the details to my secretary shirley .	Homer Simpson
this is shirley . yes , fine , he 'll be there tomorrow . goodbye !	Marge Simpson
that shirley is quite a gal . we should fix her up with barney .	Homer Simpson
homie ... i think you 're taking a little too much credit for my work . i mean , look at your t-shirt !	Marge Simpson
marge , giving me credit was your idea . now could you rub my butt ? i sat on it so much it 's a little sore .	Homer Simpson
look , i 'm sorry you 're upset . but if we tell the truth now , i 'll be humiliated in front of the whole town . then you wo n't be married to a man . you 'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish , floating outside the florida keys , cruising for rich snorkelers . you do n't want that .	Homer Simpson
i guess i do n't .	Marge Simpson
bart , skinner 's gon na be really mad at you .	Lisa Simpson
yes , you might say he 'll `` blow up . ''	Bart Simpson
whatever , i 've got some paper to mã¢chã© .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not a big fan of detention . you might say , it drives me nuts .	Bart Simpson
why does lenny need a windmill anyway ?	Marge Simpson
he wants to grind his own corn . maybe it 'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal .	Homer Simpson
switch !	Homer Simpson
switch , switch , switch .	Marge Simpson
who 'd you think would help me , my wife ? heh .	Homer Simpson
yeah , i hear it too . maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song . `` we will , we will rock you ... ''	Homer Simpson
... i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , infinity . i never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town .	Homer Simpson
homer , it 's time people knew the truth : i 'm doing the work and i want the credit .	Marge Simpson
look , i understand that you 're mad . which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor 's hired us to fix the old springfield roller coaster .	Homer Simpson
by the way , nice job installing this wall-chart bracket . if the kids ask , i did it .	Homer Simpson
you 're gon na have to fix that roller coaster yourself , 'cause i quit ... and i 'm taking this with me !	Marge Simpson
darn these counter-sunk molly clamps !	Marge Simpson
now as i see it , the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring `` going-up '' parts .	Homer Simpson
we need to replace them with kick-ass `` going-down '' parts .	Homer Simpson
hmm ... let me mull that over .	Homer Simpson
what are struts ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't know anything about struts .	Homer Simpson
and i promised these guys money i do n't have ! and they 're gon na be so mad !	Homer Simpson
maybe i can sneak home without them seeing me .	Homer Simpson
i brought you breakfast in bed .	Bart Simpson
eat it .	Bart Simpson
dad , here 's a thought : if you just gave mom credit , maybe she could help you .	Lisa Simpson
sweetie , you do n't understand . if i can do this myself , then all those lies i told will be true . do n't you want daddy 's lies to be true ?	Homer Simpson
i 'd like a daddy who lived in the real world .	Lisa Simpson
to daddy , the real world gets fainter and fainter every day .	Homer Simpson
good morning , seymour . you may be wondering what i 'm doing with this hat full of maggots ...	Bart Simpson

no one teaches me history !	Bart Simpson

perfect .	Marge Simpson
and now i give you ... the zoominator !	Homer Simpson
and now to get stinking drunk !	Homer Simpson
dad , put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth !	Lisa Simpson
sure , i 'll tell them the truth ...	Homer Simpson
the truth is that i 'm perfect and everything i touch is perfect !	Homer Simpson
oh my god , he 'll kill himself ! he 'll never hear me say `` i told you so ! ''	Marge Simpson
i 've never felt saferrrr !	Homer Simpson
uh-oh . oh . why must we preserve america 's historic roller coasters ?	Homer Simpson
thank you honey !	Homer Simpson

homer , i was pretty upset with you , but in the end , i ... i ... i-beam !	Marge Simpson

marge , i realized something when i was trapped under all that rubble : marriage is the real roller coaster . i 'm just glad i have you as my safety bar .	Homer Simpson
i forgive you my darling . get well .	Marge Simpson
as for you , young man : the next time you save your principal , try not to risk your own life .	Marge Simpson
mind your own beeswax !	Bart Simpson
i 'm gon na go look at the new babies .	Marge Simpson
look ! a shooting star !	Marge Simpson
hey , that 's great . let 's look at it after .	Homer Simpson
that almost tore my head off !	Marge Simpson
you always find an excuse not to make out .	Homer Simpson
ooh , a space marshmallow !	Homer Simpson
where do you think you 're going ?	Homer Simpson
dad , no ! it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel !	Lisa Simpson
if he 's so smart , how come he ca n't stay outta my mouth ?	Homer Simpson
how could you eat that goo ? you do n't know what galaxy it 's from !	Marge Simpson
marge , i ate it , it 's over .	Homer Simpson

marge ? i have an apology that i hope is better than all the other ones . so please listen carefully . the thing i liked best about being an ice cream man was n't the free ice cream , or the colorful toppings , or the love i received from obese children . it was giving you those sticks , and watching you smile as you turned them into art .	Homer Simpson
if it would win you back , i would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle . i hope it does n't come to that . could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little ?	Homer Simpson
if you wo n't talk to me , i 'll send in polaroids to show you how sad i am that i let you down .	Homer Simpson

can we have pancakes for dinner ?	Bart Simpson
gil 's gone ? but i have a `` no '' inside me that has to come out .	Marge Simpson
even though gil left , i still have to kick him out . i need this , or i 'll never be able to say `` no . ''	Marge Simpson
mom , i understand your psychological need , but i 'm not sure what you can do .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll tell you what . we 're going to scottsdale !	Marge Simpson
scottsdale ? will we stay at a tripletree resort ?	Homer Simpson

i 'll ask these active seniors if they know gil .	Marge Simpson
there he is !	Lisa Simpson
gunderson !	Homer Simpson
whoa , gil 's a big shot !	Bart Simpson
and to think , he and i once shared a shower .	Homer Simpson
i do n't care how successful gil is , he 's still a mooch , and i need to tell him off !	Marge Simpson
a hundred and seventeen degrees ! ooo , that reminds me .	Homer Simpson
there 's water under the seat !	Homer Simpson
now remember , marge , we 're not buying anything for more than one-point-two . but if i scratch my nose , that means we can go to one-point-five .	Homer Simpson
gil , remember me ?	Marge Simpson
listen , bub . i have something to say to you , and it ca n't wait .	Marge Simpson
the only house i 'm interested in is my own , which you defiled for eleven hellish months . but now i 've learned to say `` no ! '' no to your mooching ! no to your manipulation ! and a big fat no to the kingsbridge school district !	Marge Simpson
no ! ! !	Marge Simpson
this is so exciting -- watching a movie outside with the whole town .	Marge Simpson
dad , there are n't any places left to sit .	Lisa Simpson
there 's a spot !	Bart Simpson
we 're not gon na make it !	Marge Simpson
ooh , this is one of our trips to barnacle bay ! we used to rent a beach house there every summer .	Marge Simpson
i was so happy on that island ...	Marge Simpson
i 've never seen marge want to go somewhere so badly . i 'm gon na take her back there ... by burning that home movie onto a dvd .	Homer Simpson
i 've never seen marge like a dvd about a place so much . i 'm gon na make her dream come true ... by downloading that movie onto her ipod .	Homer Simpson
marge , i 'm sorry i could n't figure out how to get that movie onto your ipod ... so i 'm taking the family on a surprise vacation to barnacle bay !	Homer Simpson
ta-da !	Lisa Simpson
where 's maggie ?	Marge Simpson
ta-da !	Lisa Simpson
we left plenty of food so you wo n't starve .	Homer Simpson
i was talking to the cat !	Homer Simpson
it 's the famous barnacle bay fog ! there 's even a poem about it ! `` oh cotton candy in gossamer light / thy soft gray kiss upon my cheek '' it smells like heinie !	Marge Simpson
my childhood paradise -- it 's a dump !	Marge Simpson
ugh . this is the most disgusting place we 've ever gone .	Lisa Simpson
what about brazil ?	Bart Simpson
after brazil .	Lisa Simpson
this was my favorite seahorse . i called him mr. funnygoodfeeling ... oh god , someone carved swastikas on your eyes !	Marge Simpson
oh marge , i 'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate .	Homer Simpson
you could caramel my arm ...	Homer Simpson
i did n't say `` stop . ''	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's too much sugar !	Marge Simpson
it 's not sugar , it 's caramel !	Homer Simpson
excuse me , skipper -- this island used to be a paradise . what happened ?	Marge Simpson
i bet it was bill clinton 's fault .	Homer Simpson
slick willie wiggles out of another one .	Homer Simpson
yum-yum fish ?	Lisa Simpson
yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here . they 're the most delicious fish in the ocean .	Marge Simpson
better than cod ?	Bart Simpson
much better .	Marge Simpson
oh , baby !	Bart Simpson
maybe you just overfished them .	Lisa Simpson
maybe you killed them all .	Lisa Simpson
maybe you should be ashamed of yourself !	Lisa Simpson
i guess in the end , nothing 's as good as you remember .	Marge Simpson
oh , i ca n't stand to see your mother unhappy . but this town could be great for your mother again . and i know three people who can make it happen .	Homer Simpson
nice brush work , emily . nathaniel , you could learn a lot from her .	Homer Simpson
oh ma-arge , we have a surpri-ise ! come to the win-dow ! and look down at the stre-et !	Homer Simpson

blue pinwheel , red pinwheel , big white ball , wait for the `` aaahhh ... ''	Homer Simpson
a green spinner to build suspense ... and then the big finale , the :	Homer Simpson
oh , so , forming an angry mob , eh ? who we goin ' after ?	Homer Simpson
well , at least they left your underwear on . that was nice of them .	Marge Simpson
i think the hook is touching my brain . .	Homer Simpson
my husband meant no harm . there must be some way he can pay for what he did . he 's good at opening jars .	Marge Simpson
dammit !	Homer Simpson
queer strange or queer gay ?	Homer Simpson
how many yum-yum fish did we get ?	Homer Simpson
ew , it tastes terrible !	Homer Simpson
finally . something even i would n't eat . well , maybe a little more .	Homer Simpson
terrible .	Homer Simpson
here you go -- beer-battered shrimp .	Homer Simpson

repent ! repent ! before it 's too late ! i always wanted to do that in a new england church .	Lisa Simpson
nicely done , lis . instead of killing living things , they 're just killing trees .	Bart Simpson
this is not what i wanted at all !	Lisa Simpson

chill thunder ! `` chill thunder '' !	Lisa Simpson
you 're all idiots . i 'm putting it on chill thunder lite .	Homer Simpson
ooo , now that 's smooth .	Marge Simpson
hey ! nobody cuts me off !	Homer Simpson
how 's it goin ' ?	Homer Simpson
homer , no ! revenge never solves anything .	Marge Simpson
then what 's america doing in iraq ?	Homer Simpson
well , let me tell you a story about a time revenge brought only unhappiness and misery . it happened many years ago in paris --	Marge Simpson
no , france .	Marge Simpson
there was a happy young family ...	Marge Simpson
papa , may we have chocolat ?	Bart Simpson
papa , may we have petit fours ?	Lisa Simpson
may we ? may we ? mais oui !	Homer Simpson
oh mon cher , i am the luckiest wife in the entire sixteenth arrondissement ! let us kiss with the tongues .	Marge Simpson

i do n't want the kids to see me this way !	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , they 're still drunk from school !	Marge Simpson
uh ... deux ... troi ... .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't write that ! even if i did love england , i 'd play it cool . wait for it to come to me .	Homer Simpson
you moron ! i 'm already alive !	Homer Simpson
i should n't be here , i was framed !	Homer Simpson
are you gon na torture me ?	Homer Simpson
nine a.m. ? !	Homer Simpson
i swear revenge on meaux ! even if it takes me the rest of my life ! can you loosen my arm so i can shake my fist ?	Homer Simpson
revenge ! okay .	Homer Simpson
oh , little mouse , you are the only thing that keeps me sane .	Homer Simpson

oh sorry , i was n't listening . i was checking out my reflection in this yellow water . lookin ' good .	Homer Simpson
and decrepit .	Homer Simpson
oooh , the the ! but why are you helping me ?	Homer Simpson

i wonder how long this tunnel ...	Homer Simpson

mon dieu ! weee !	Homer Simpson
ew ! silver !	Homer Simpson

this is my lucky day .	Homer Simpson
frãˆre jacques , frãˆre jacques / dormez-vous , dormez-vous ...	Lisa Simpson
ooh , the count of monte cristo ! can we go ? we have n't been to any parties since that soirã©e at the bastille .	Marge Simpson
madame , you have the shapely , hairless knuckles of a queen .	Homer Simpson
monsieur meaux , i would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening 's entertainment .	Homer Simpson
here it is : the harmless chair of relaxation !	Homer Simpson
little do you know that the count of monte cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours .	Homer Simpson
i have returned !	Homer Simpson
oh . hold on .	Homer Simpson
homer , you 're back !	Marge Simpson
oui oui ! and i have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge !	Homer Simpson
homer ...	Marge Simpson

you killed my husband !	Marge Simpson
papa meaux ! papa meaux !	Lisa Simpson
you guys liked him ?	Homer Simpson
we were together for five years ! now who 's gon na take care of the triplets ?	Marge Simpson
but marge , i did it all for you !	Homer Simpson
for me , huh ? what took you so long ?	Marge Simpson
it takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome ! plus , in the middle , i had to take revenge on some of my contractors .	Homer Simpson
you spent so much time plotting your revenge , you lost everything that really mattered . come on , kids .	Marge Simpson
so you see homer , revenge only leads to misery .	Marge Simpson
were n't you listening ? i just told you a whole story about revenge .	Marge Simpson
oh , right -- revenge ! !	Homer Simpson
i 'm gon na get my revenge ! and if i get caught , i 'm pinning it on the baby like the time i shot mr. burns .	Homer Simpson
dad , wait , i 've got a story about why revenge is wrong .	Lisa Simpson
is it `` the count of monte cristo ? '' 'cause i love that story .	Homer Simpson
no .	Lisa Simpson
i call it ... '' revenge of the geeks . ''	Lisa Simpson
milhouse , thanks to you , the nerds can breathe easy . except the ones with asthma . which is all of them . but still , it 's great .	Lisa Simpson
milhouse , what 's gotten into you ?	Lisa Simpson
no , no ! you 've already got your revenge !	Lisa Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
that 's the only line i get in your stupid story ? !	Bart Simpson
there are no small parts , just small actors .	Lisa Simpson
milhouse , do n't you see ... you 're addicted to revenge .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm really sorry .	Bart Simpson
i see . while it would be an honor to be your queen ...	Lisa Simpson
i feel it would be best if we just stayed friends .	Lisa Simpson
wow . that had what i really like in a story : an ending .	Homer Simpson
the point , dad , is that when you take revenge , you become just as bad as the person you harm .	Lisa Simpson
no , sweetie . the lesson is : never put down your weapon .	Homer Simpson
revenge !	Homer Simpson
this is it . it 's taken all day , we 've missed our flight to hawaii , but finally , i 'll get my revenge .	Homer Simpson
dad , wait ! you have n't heard my story .	Bart Simpson
you ? you 're too dumb to tell a story .	Homer Simpson
no , seriously , you 're great -- let 's hear it .	Homer Simpson
my story takes place in a time i call `` the past '' .	Bart Simpson
that stunk worse than boiled cabbage .	Bart Simpson
you should feel lucky . not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night .	Marge Simpson
parents who are still alive , i might add .	Homer Simpson
this alley looks dangerous . i 'd better turn my ring around .	Marge Simpson
hoo-boy .	Marge Simpson
you do n't frighten me !	Homer Simpson
or my wife !	Homer Simpson
or my ...	Homer Simpson
shut up !	Marge Simpson
avenge me . in flamboyant impractical fashion .	Homer Simpson
i want to avenge you , but i do n't know how .	Bart Simpson
holy hannah ! i 've got more muscles than a new england clambake . now all i need is a superhero name .	Bart Simpson
i 'll keep thinking .	Bart Simpson
i 'm bart-man .	Bart Simpson
but it did n't bring your parents back . tell me , big boy , was it really worth it ?	Lisa Simpson
so you see , revenge is great . and there 's three ways to talk about it . although two of the ways were kind of the same way , and even the third one might have worked better as a halloween story ...	Bart Simpson
that 's okay , boy . the two of us got to talking .	Homer Simpson
two .	Homer Simpson
i do n't know . let 's just lay here till we figure it out .	Homer Simpson
hm ...	Marge Simpson
what 's the matter , sweetie ?	Marge Simpson
tomorrow 's multicultural day at school .	Lisa Simpson
now what do they want ?	Homer Simpson
i 've got to give a presentation about our family 's heritage . but ours is so boring !	Lisa Simpson
aw , grampa . we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can .	Marge Simpson
camera 's broken !	Homer Simpson
hey lis , check it out ! with some clever scissor work , i can make the `` lakeland butter '' indian maiden show me her boobs .	Bart Simpson
clean , dirty clean , dirty clean , dirty ...	Bart Simpson
bart , stop that . native americans are a proud people with a noble heritage ... a noble heritage that anyone can claim !	Lisa Simpson
cool -- look what snap 's doing to pop , while crackle watches !	Bart Simpson
`` my great-great , great-great great grandmother was a native american . she was a member of the ... ''	Lisa Simpson
... hitachee tribe. , hitachee tribe,2	Lisa Simpson
wait , is it wrong for me to appropriate the culture of a long-suffering people ?	Lisa Simpson
you 're right . i 'll just need to find `` traditional garb '' ...	Lisa Simpson
... and so my proud people were nearly destroyed by the warfare , disease , and greed of the invading europeans .	Lisa Simpson
today the hitachees have dwindled to a handful , and our detailed genealogical records were cruelly destroyed by the white man . so , any attempts to research my tribe would be the ultimate insult .	Lisa Simpson
oh ... great ! i 'd ... love to .	Lisa Simpson
if this works , i 'll go faster than any ten-year-old has ever gone .	Bart Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !	Bart Simpson
my last words are `` lisa suuuucks '' !	Bart Simpson
really ? hmmm .	Bart Simpson
that 's it ! i want a license !	Bart Simpson
no , to drive .	Bart Simpson
no way -- i do n't want my guts touching some sick guy !	Bart Simpson
oh , i ca n't believe this day is already here : me taking you for your first driving lesson .	Homer Simpson
hey , that jerk cut us off ! pull alongside !	Homer Simpson
eat marshall tucker , idiot !	Homer Simpson
homer , is that you ? !	Marge Simpson
floor it !	Homer Simpson
the hitachees invented women 's lacrosse ... soft luggage ...	Lisa Simpson
and that thing where you 're walking and someone 's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around ? they had seven names for that .	Lisa Simpson
whoa , you just blew my mind !	Homer Simpson
uh , thank you and goodnight .	Lisa Simpson
show 's over , let 's go !	Lisa Simpson
what 's your hurry ?	Homer Simpson
well , some of my report ... um ... was n't thoroughly fact-checked .	Lisa Simpson
aw , my little girl 's just like cbs news .	Homer Simpson
lisa , it was wonderful ! i am such a proud hitachee mother .	Marge Simpson
yes , we 're among the lostest .	Lisa Simpson
centered . centered . you know where the four states come together ?	Lisa Simpson
not there . not even close .	Lisa Simpson
we were south ... west of ... north dakota-lahoma .	Lisa Simpson
hey , guys . i 'll see you in a bit . i entered a thousand mile baja road race .	Bart Simpson
hold on there , boy . if you wan na keep using that car , you 'd better start pullin ' your weight .	Homer Simpson
this cell phone is so i can call you whenever i need your driving services . i 've put in my own ring tone !	Homer Simpson
hello , bart ?	Homer Simpson
i need you to go the gas station . tell them you need to inflate your tires , but actually you inflate these volleyballs .	Homer Simpson
then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion .	Homer Simpson
hello ?	Bart Simpson
bart ... buddy ! it 's your dad ! i need a ride ! i think i 'm in chinatown . not our chinatown .	Homer Simpson
slow down ! you 're too close to that car ! your hands should be at ten and two , not three and nothing !	Lisa Simpson
y'know , it 'd be a real shame if someone started investigating your `` indian heritage . ''	Bart Simpson
i 'll be good .	Lisa Simpson
oh , man ! what now ?	Bart Simpson
boy , i do n't wan na freak you out , but i 'm calling from inside the trunk .	Homer Simpson
that was me . some very un-cool people put me in here .	Homer Simpson
this sucks ! i ca n't do anything fun , 'cause i 'm doing so many stupid errands !	Bart Simpson
shut up , shut up , shut up !	Bart Simpson
it 's dark in here !	Homer Simpson
i got ta get outta this town for a while . time to put the pedal to the metal .	Bart Simpson
hm , north haverbrook . the very name conjures up romance and intrigue .	Bart Simpson

how religious can you be if you 're pregnant ?	Bart Simpson
good answer .	Bart Simpson
look , darcy , maybe there 's still a way we can get married .	Bart Simpson
utah ? home of america 's most powerful weirdoes ?	Bart Simpson

the people of my tribe lived in harmony with the land .	Lisa Simpson
eating mock buffalo steaks made from peaceful turnip roots , uh , they ... environment ... umm , dignity ... corn god ... i 'm sorry , i ca n't do this !	Lisa Simpson
i made it all up ! there is no hitachee tribe ! i took the name from my microwave ! but surely you can forgive a little girl who --	Lisa Simpson
you know , my great-great grandmother was an indian . i guess i should 've mentioned that before , huh ?	Homer Simpson

or a chicken club ... or a reuben ... or a monte cristo ... or a ... pull over behind that billboard !	Homer Simpson

experts see new links between pacifier overuse and low achievement !	Marge Simpson
maggie . honey , this is for your own good . growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy .	Marge Simpson

maggie , i 'm sorry you miss your pacifier . but when a mother makes a decision , she has to stick by it .	Marge Simpson
okay , okay , you can have it back !	Marge Simpson

the only person who thinks you 're a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath .	Bart Simpson
and dad , i hope you learned something from this .	Lisa Simpson
i sure have . plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it has n't been perfected to where you look really good . when it is , everyone should get it .	Homer Simpson

i 've gotten so much accomplished : i saved `` lost '' , watched all of `` rome '' in a day , and got through `` two and a half men '' in two and a half minutes . then i ran out of space and had to choose between `` sophie 's choice '' and `` schindler 's list . ''	Marge Simpson
why is everything hollywood makes so excellent ? whyyyy ?	Homer Simpson

more ribs for me !	Homer Simpson
i see no grill , oven , or food of any kind .	Lisa Simpson

finally , some service . now listen . we wan na sit under a cool state license plate -- michigan or better .	Homer Simpson
that voice !	Lisa Simpson
that commercial was a trick -- specifically designed to lure our family here !	Lisa Simpson

sideshow bob !	Lisa Simpson
next time a commercial comes on , i 'm gon na close my eyes , cover my ears and scream as loud as i can .	Homer Simpson
i 'd like to know if wes doobner is aware of what you 're doing in his restaurant .	Homer Simpson

oh great , here it comes -- all the boring things you 've done since the last time you did n't kill us .	Bart Simpson
you never ask what we 've been up to . we went to the strawberry patch and i picked the most strawberries !	Lisa Simpson
nobody do it .	Homer Simpson
yeah , yeah , we 've all been to england . is this going somewhere ?	Bart Simpson

macbeth , act one , scene seven . look it up !	Lisa Simpson
yet another new restaurant fails .	Homer Simpson

stop feeling sorry for him ! he 's a homicidal maniac ! he deserves to fry !	Bart Simpson
he cheats at uno !	Homer Simpson
bob 's playing all of you like saps . this man 's a killer !	Bart Simpson
yoink ! foiled again , freak !	Bart Simpson
oh my god , it 's beautiful ! are you buying this ?	Bart Simpson
bart , i know this is nuts , but try to look sad .	Marge Simpson
i 'm not sad . i have nothing to be sad about . nothing !	Bart Simpson
well , i guess the rest of us should pay our respects .	Marge Simpson
yeah , well , between you and me , i still ca n't stand him .	Homer Simpson
i still ca n't stand him ... i still ca n't stand him ... i still ca n't stand him ...	Homer Simpson
i do n't care about these church jerks ... church jerks ... church jerks ...	Homer Simpson
homer , your behavior is heinous .	Marge Simpson
... anus ! ... anus ! ... anus !	Marge Simpson
stupid sideshow bob . even when he 's dead he wrecks my life . i hope he 's in hell eating a barf burger .	Bart Simpson
hey , are n't you bob 's brother ?	Bart Simpson
that 's stupid . you talk like you 're smart , but you 're stupid .	Bart Simpson
sounds boring .	Bart Simpson
well , i guess i could say goodbye .	Bart Simpson
i 'm going to set things right . wan na come with me ?	Bart Simpson

bob , it 's me , bart . i came here to tell you i never meant for you to die . i just wanted you to go to jail and get beat up a lot . now everyone wishes i was dead ...	Bart Simpson
ahhhhh ! sideshow bob !	Bart Simpson
bob planned this from the beginning --	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
he wanted to be captured at the restaurant !	Lisa Simpson
yes .	Homer Simpson
he would never get a shakespeare quote wrong --	Lisa Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
his mother was a shakespearean actress !	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah !	Homer Simpson
his father is a doctor ...	Lisa Simpson
a doctor , huh ?	Homer Simpson
... so when bob collapsed in the courtroom ...	Lisa Simpson
i remember .	Homer Simpson
... his father could take that opportunity to inject bob with a powerful drug that simulated death .	Lisa Simpson
uh-huh .	Homer Simpson
it was a diabolical scheme , and every member of his family played a part !	Lisa Simpson
are you done ? 'cause i 've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes .	Homer Simpson
stop that cremation !	Lisa Simpson
hey , what smells so good ?	Homer Simpson
hot ! hot ! hot !	Bart Simpson
eat hobo remains !	Homer Simpson
get me outta here . what are you doing ? i ca n't breathe !	Bart Simpson
marge , he 's got to get over his fear of coffins .	Homer Simpson
i grew suspicious when i saw the casket had extra room built in for your feet .	Lisa Simpson
why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man ?	Lisa Simpson
nice try , bob -- but you did n't count on one thing .	Bart Simpson
you stink like my butt ! take him away !	Bart Simpson
well , this time i think sideshow bob is finally locked up for good .	Marge Simpson
yeah . the only thing that 's gon na be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake !	Homer Simpson
wow , i must have really tied one on last night .	Homer Simpson
no more drinking .	Homer Simpson
six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend i actually got home at three a.m .	Homer Simpson

moe , my family 's gone , my dog hates me , and i ca n't remember what happened last night . was i here ?	Homer Simpson
a `` forget-me-shot ? '' never heard of it .	Homer Simpson
mmm , pickle ...	Homer Simpson

dad , i ca n't remember what i did last night . do you have any idea ?	Homer Simpson
your memory bubble and you .	Homer Simpson
i 'm afraid i did something to make marge and the kids leave me .	Homer Simpson
really ? well , that 's great , dad . how can i ever repay you ?	Homer Simpson

how 'bout the deja viewmaster ?	Homer Simpson
remembrance of things fast ?	Homer Simpson

bo-ring .	Homer Simpson
ow . ow . ow ! ! ! three , two , one . owwwww ! ! !	Homer Simpson
what the hell ?	Homer Simpson
this bubble allows you to view any past event from your life . it 's got that new bubble smell .	Homer Simpson
aw , i landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them .	Homer Simpson
oh , i miss those bygone days of earlier this week . but i 'm needed in a darker place .	Homer Simpson
another man ... with my wife ... in my house ... on top of my tv guide ?	Homer Simpson
i 've got ta find out who that guy is , but i need help . someone like bart , only smart . lisa !	Homer Simpson
lisa , i 'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life . you wan na join me ?	Homer Simpson

i 'll teach you to beat up yester-me !	Homer Simpson
who was it with ?	Homer Simpson
right .	Homer Simpson
kids , your mom is with another man , and i need you to help me find out who he is . hm ... is this really something i should show you kids ?	Homer Simpson
it 's okay -- we 're not really your kids . we 're just representations of them , that you created in your mind .	Homer Simpson
really ? then if i created all this ... that means i can have pizza anytime i want !	Homer Simpson
hello , i 'd like to order a pizza . thirty-five minutes ? !	Homer Simpson
see ? that 's where my memory stops . who the heck is that guy ?	Homer Simpson
what if you just moved the bottle ?	Homer Simpson
all right . let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly .	Homer Simpson
how can i get my memory to work ?	Homer Simpson
the mother of my children with the reason for my children !	Homer Simpson
stop , homer ! please !	Marge Simpson
noooo !	Homer Simpson
your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless !	Homer Simpson
my life is ruined .	Homer Simpson
goodbye , cruel world .	Homer Simpson
and goodbye , cruller world .	Homer Simpson
wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy , then i 'm not gon na do it .	Homer Simpson
my life 's flashing before my eyes .	Homer Simpson
a life well-lived . until last night . i guess i 'll have to watch that now .	Homer Simpson
hey , what 's going on here ? !	Homer Simpson
oh homer , i did n't want you to find out this way . we were planning a surprise party for you .	Marge Simpson
a surprise party ?	Homer Simpson
this magic marker 's running out of ink .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled .	Marge Simpson
are you kidding ? the mother of my children with the reason for my children ! this is gon na be the greatest party ever !	Homer Simpson
oh my god ! it 's like christmas in december ! let 's celebrate now .	Homer Simpson
stop , homer ! please !	Marge Simpson
my eye !	Marge Simpson
do n't worry honey , i 'll get you an ice pack . where 's the ice pack ?	Homer Simpson
so marge was n't cheating on me , i never hit her , and my family is throwing me an awesome party . thank god i figured it out before i did anything stupid .	Homer Simpson
oh , right .	Homer Simpson
oh my god ! i 'm not dead !	Homer Simpson
homie , this is your party !	Marge Simpson
this is great ! i must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair .	Homer Simpson
hmm , okay .	Marge Simpson
what plan ?	Homer Simpson
marge put so much work into that party . the least i could do is be surprised . if only i could forget what happened today .	Homer Simpson
hmmm ... the only problem is , i 'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding duffman . no doubt i 'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold 's horns upon my brow . and that will make me want to jump off a --	Homer Simpson
for the love of god , make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce .	Homer Simpson
because i did n't want him finding out about the party . i mean , he 's okay , but you know he 'd bring sarah , and i just do n't care for that woman .	Marge Simpson
and when you pushed me off the bridge , it 's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here .	Homer Simpson
hmmm ... the only thing that still does n't make sense is why the dog attacked me .	Homer Simpson
because you never feed him , walk him or let him out to pee .	Bart Simpson
oh yeah .	Homer Simpson
who 's an angry dog ? who 's an angry dog ?	Homer Simpson
are n't you going to drink ?	Marge Simpson
no , this is a moment i want to remember .	Homer Simpson
oh no ! he 's talking to that mailroom guy .	Homer Simpson
listen carefully . i have taken your wife hostage . if you do n't have a wife , i have kidnapped your brother . nod if you understand .	Homer Simpson
now , back away from burns and i will let your dog live .	Homer Simpson
good . now stop and dance like a happy prospector .	Homer Simpson
happier !	Homer Simpson
happier !	Homer Simpson
happier !	Homer Simpson
oh right . just leave ! but kick like a rockette !	Homer Simpson
we 're free !	Homer Simpson
set the table , marge !	Homer Simpson
i can already taste those deep-fried pork chops !	Homer Simpson
do n't you remember what today is ?	Marge Simpson
when you ask me that it 's never good .	Homer Simpson
it 's the first of the month . the day you promised to start your new diet .	Marge Simpson
i 'm just really worried about your weight . bart says that we got a call from nasa and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit .	Marge Simpson
marge , that was a joke !	Homer Simpson
but it comes from a true place ...	Marge Simpson
well , if i 'm gon na start a diet , this is my last chance to eat all the crap i love .	Homer Simpson
i think i 'll miss you most of all , captain corndog 's schnitzel palace . no tears , homer .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh , ca n't let marge see this .	Homer Simpson
a drive-up trashcan !	Homer Simpson
this must be how the rich toss out their gold . and as long as i 'm cleaning out the family chariot ...	Homer Simpson
cups ... newspapers ... bottles ... tricycle ... lawn chair ... un-cashed checks ...	Homer Simpson
hmm ... `` dispose of proper -- '' this book is too hard .	Homer Simpson
now for a victory cigar .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't stand to see a grown burger cry . we must rebuild fast food boulevard !	Homer Simpson
i do n't know about you , but i do n't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters ... where the chairs are n't attached to the tables ... and where i ca n't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls . i say we rebuild the fast-food district -- bigger and better than ever !	Homer Simpson
but wo n't that just shift the burden to your children ?	Lisa Simpson
no , you idiot . we just pay for it with another bond issue .	Bart Simpson
let her figure out someone to dump it on .	Bart Simpson
that means that springfield 's presidential primary will be first in the nation ! even earlier than new hampshire !	Lisa Simpson
this election is on every channel .	Marge Simpson
c'mon , marge , it 's primary fever -- catch it !	Homer Simpson
that 's what you said about yellow fever , and that was no fun .	Marge Simpson
i think it 's exciting -- springfield is the center of the political universe . i feel like a pundit in a think tank !	Lisa Simpson
think tank , eh ?	Homer Simpson
what ? not allowed to get one right ?	Homer Simpson
die hard two !	Homer Simpson
i live in that place !	Homer Simpson
he 's got my vote .	Homer Simpson
dear god . what have i done ?	Homer Simpson
oh my god , they 're going steady -- did everyone see that ? !	Homer Simpson
that was the best milkshake ad i 've ever seen . it makes me want a milkshake !	Homer Simpson
look , we all care about quintile disparity , but the democrats ca n't win with another prissy brainiac .	Lisa Simpson
i wonder who that could ... beeee !	Marge Simpson
stop all this pandering !	Marge Simpson
if you have n't sprung from , or are n't married to my loins , get the hell out of this house !	Homer Simpson
you too , fred thompson .	Homer Simpson
is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as i am ?	Homer Simpson
why do n't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate , and write him in ?	Homer Simpson
no , no . this candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous .	Homer Simpson
no . but you 're close .	Homer Simpson
what i did made the tv thing happen .	Homer Simpson
mom , they 're taking ralph 's candidacy seriously ! this is a disaster .	Lisa Simpson
speaking of disasters , have you seen this ? springfield dodge bought too much inventory , and they 've only got one weekend to get rid of all the '07s !	Marge Simpson
lisa , i 'm sure this wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter .	Marge Simpson
i dig the wig ! i dig the wig !	Homer Simpson
oh dear god .	Lisa Simpson
c'mon lis , hop on the wiggum wagon . ralph said he 'd let me be secretary of indian burns . here 's my first official act :	Lisa Simpson
ow !	Lisa Simpson
lisa , being president is easy . you just point the army and shoot .	Homer Simpson
and ralph is only eight years old ! it says in the constitution you have to be thirty-five .	Lisa Simpson
the constitution ? i 'm pretty sure the patriot act killed it to ensure our freedoms .	Bart Simpson
oh , the patriot act is so terrible ! the government might find out what library books i take out . what 's next -- finding out what operas i go to ?	Homer Simpson
leave him alone , you vultures !	Lisa Simpson
ralph and i used to date .	Lisa Simpson
ralph , they have no right to do this to you . they just want to use you .	Lisa Simpson
maybe you whaaa -- ?	Lisa Simpson
maybe you would n't be such a bad president .	Lisa Simpson
i like the sound of that .	Lisa Simpson
dad , i 'm freezing .	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry , kids . these wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm .	Homer Simpson
we would n't be in this trouble if you 'd just paid the heating bill !	Marge Simpson
i thought global warming would take care of it . al gore ca n't do anything right .	Homer Simpson
i got some old magazines to burn . `` popular science , '' `` redbook '' , `` big and tall halloween costume '' catalogue ...	Bart Simpson
next item ...	Bart Simpson
no ! ! ! that 's my memory box !	Marge Simpson
mom , i did n't know you went to college !	Lisa Simpson
yeah , you always said that after high school , dad `` blessed you with the unplanned miracle of me . ''	Bart Simpson
hey , parents are allowed to keep some secrets .	Marge Simpson
like which kid 's their favorite ! it 's lisa .	Homer Simpson
you know , mom and dad are almost forty , and bart is ten . that means you did n't have him until way after high school .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , what happened while i was chillin ' in dad 's junk ?	Bart Simpson
there is a part of our past that we have n't told you kids about . a turbulent part .	Marge Simpson
c'mon . more turbulent than now ?	Bart Simpson
we 're in every kind of therapy !	Lisa Simpson
things happened between your mother and me that we 're not proud of . it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties .	Homer Simpson
the nineties ? never heard of it .	Bart Simpson
oh , it was a wonderful time . the iraq war was over once and for all , a struggling matt groening created `` futurama , '' and young people believed in their dreams , thanks to a tv show called `` melrose place '' ...	Homer Simpson
your mother and i were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together .	Homer Simpson
we did n't have a lot of money , but we were young and in love .	Homer Simpson
like all young people , i had a musical dream .	Homer Simpson
a dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves .	Homer Simpson
but our happiness was about to unravel just like kevin costner 's career : because of the postman .	Marge Simpson
but marge 's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world .	Homer Simpson
we 're in the middle of our own story , thank you .	Lisa Simpson
anyway , i was growing to admire my professor more and more ...	Marge Simpson
homer 's perfect for me ! just look at this note : `` i miss you . '' aww ...	Marge Simpson
marge ! marge ! where are you ? !	Homer Simpson
mom , why 'd you stop talking for two and a half minutes ?	Bart Simpson
it seemed like twenty .	Lisa Simpson
whatever , homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life ...	Marge Simpson
i was so depressed , i spent all my time in a bar .	Homer Simpson
i had finally realized every rock star 's dream ...	Homer Simpson
... hating being famous .	Homer Simpson
a tale of two young outlaws in love ...	Homer Simpson
unfortunately , as i later learned , that was n't heroin . it was insulin .	Marge Simpson
homer really did need those injections .	Marge Simpson
i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos .	Homer Simpson
with the nineties drawing to a close , and the sydney olympics to look forward to , our love rekindled ...	Homer Simpson
and one moonlit night , i finally had fun at a mini-golf course .	Homer Simpson
homer , stop !	Marge Simpson
you do n't have to tell the kids everything !	Marge Simpson
what did i miss ? how did it end ?	Lisa Simpson
did you two ever get back together ?	Bart Simpson
yep , that professor could n't keep me and marge apart .	Homer Simpson
i mean , unless he had been a little nicer at the beach .	Homer Simpson
well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- homie is where my heart is .	Marge Simpson
and once we were back together , i was too happy ever to grunge again .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't wait to see my valentine 's day surprise !	Marge Simpson
good , 'cause i 'm parking at it right now .	Homer Simpson
a carnival ? what 's so romantic about this ?	Marge Simpson
goodbye ! / see ya later !	Lisa Simpson
for the next two hours , we 'll be kid free . it 'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall .	Homer Simpson
that was the best christmas ever .	Homer Simpson
ah , the tunnel of love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy .	Homer Simpson
marge ! look over there !	Homer Simpson
mom and dad are in there . wan na ruin their fun ?	Bart Simpson

maybe you 're drunk .	Homer Simpson
homie , lisa 's dancing has made me really , really , happy .	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
fatherhood hurts my brain .	Homer Simpson

what 'd you say ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm just saying it 's gon na be hard for me to quit , especially before the recital .	Lisa Simpson
i thought you might have trouble with this . that 's why i 'm assigning someone to keep watch over you . someone you 'd never expect .	Homer Simpson

i want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of americans . for years we 've known how dangerous it is . it stunts your growth . and it 's marketed to children . i 'm talking about ballet .	Lisa Simpson
ballet is unnatural and unfair to women . i shall now cast off the shoes of oppression !	Lisa Simpson
this is my favorite family tradition -- ice cream after a botched recital .	Homer Simpson
and i 'm happy to be smoke-free -- thanks to these children 's nicotine patches .	Lisa Simpson
and i realize it 's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children .	Marge Simpson

the money helps us serve the community ! we plant trees , pick up litter , cut up milk bones for old dogs ...	Lisa Simpson
and i used rhetoric in my answer !	Lisa Simpson
where 's all the money ?	Lisa Simpson
sir , i did n't get this `` skepticism '' merit badge falling for promises like that .	Lisa Simpson
i would strongly support that measure .	Lisa Simpson
homer simpson . i know a lot of you from church , and the market and such . and i 'm not much for talkin ' -- but seems to me , in hard times like these that we americans come together .	Homer Simpson
so i say we roll up our sleeves , and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money .	Homer Simpson
panic not , fellow springfielders !	Lisa Simpson
i 've gone through the town 's financial records , and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes .	Lisa Simpson
hey dad , that 's the singer you used to manage !	Lisa Simpson
oh , right . dad was colonel homer and he wore that awesome suit and lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out ! but i forget how mom felt about it ...	Bart Simpson
kids , marriage is like a car . along the way it has its bumps and dings , and this country ca n't make one that lasts more than five years . with lurleen i just walked past the showroom and did n't even go inside . now let 's return to watching the news .	Homer Simpson
i told her not to go into one of those .	Homer Simpson
double ew !	Lisa Simpson

confederate degenerate ?	Homer Simpson
southern-fried succubus ?	Lisa Simpson
hee-haw ho ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't get it , lurleen -- how did you lose all your money ? did it go up your nose ? between your toes ?	Bart Simpson
boy , you sure have married a lot of super-hunks .	Homer Simpson
she turned down lenny ... and carl ? that 's like someone who does n't like hamburgers or hotdogs . what could make her hate men like that ?	Marge Simpson

i never dreamed the future could be scary . let 's go , lisa . we 've got some worms to save !	Homer Simpson
bees .	Lisa Simpson
worms , bees , ticks , fleas ... let 's go , go , go !	Homer Simpson
animals can get sick ? !	Homer Simpson
you 're the nerd .	Homer Simpson
there 's one on lisa !	Homer Simpson
hold still , sweetie . daddy will kill it . and this time no screw-ups .	Homer Simpson
how do we catch her without hurting her ?	Lisa Simpson
how long is that ?	Lisa Simpson
marge , remember when we were talking about our worst fears ?	Homer Simpson
uh-huh ...	Marge Simpson
and mine was snakes and yours was ...	Homer Simpson
never being a grandmother ?	Marge Simpson
really ? i thought it was lisa with a beard of bees . well whatever , brace yourself .	Homer Simpson
lisa , i do n't like this at all .	Marge Simpson
it 's not for long . but until they find a suitable habitat , this beard is the only hope for these bees .	Lisa Simpson
relax , mom . i 'll mold them into a shape you know and love .	Bart Simpson
stop milhousing your sister !	Marge Simpson
now take it off before they sting you !	Marge Simpson
actually , bees rarely sting when they 're in a cluster . they only attack to defend their hive .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know . all it takes is one troubled loner .	Marge Simpson
please let me keep them for just a little longer .	Lisa Simpson
okay . one night .	Marge Simpson
um mom , maybe you should n't have put so much syrup on the pancakes .	Bart Simpson
the secret is not to swallow the stingers .	Homer Simpson
dad , do n't eat the bees !	Lisa Simpson
they 're just drones , lisa . they only live for like five minutes anyway . and they only have haploid cells , not diploid like me and bart .	Homer Simpson
yeah !	Bart Simpson
listen lisa , i was trying to think of a way to help your bees and i remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town .	Marge Simpson
which used to be a beautiful , thriving greenhouse 'til i was hired to run it .	Homer Simpson
your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse . plus there are flowers , and it 's near a prison so they 'll have a place to sting people .	Marge Simpson
oh mom , it 's perfect !	Lisa Simpson
go , live your lives , get off my face !	Lisa Simpson
oh , i miss them .	Lisa Simpson
now you know how i 'll feel when you go to college .	Marge Simpson
you 'll always have bart . always .	Lisa Simpson
but he 'll be gone a lot repairing refrigerators .	Marge Simpson
always .	Lisa Simpson
ooh , another grobanite !	Lisa Simpson
i knew it !	Homer Simpson
mr. burns , you ca n't do this !	Lisa Simpson
there 's only one place in town where the bees can survive . and mr. burns wants to tear it down . please , people . you did n't listen to me about the snail darter , you did n't listen to me about the osprey , and you did n't listen to me about the javelina .	Lisa Simpson
apparently not feisty enough . future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures . i am not just asking you to save the bees . i am asking you to save your souls .	Lisa Simpson
you do n't ?	Lisa Simpson
nay .	Lisa Simpson
i know it 's not your fault , muk mu . you 're a gentle , loving soul .	Lisa Simpson
mr. burns took away their sanctuary , and now they are n't strong enough to survive on their own .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm going home . give me the keys to my bike lock .	Lisa Simpson
give me the keys !	Lisa Simpson
i 'd do anything to cheer up my little girl .	Homer Simpson
huh ? but how are we supposed to combine the dna of two strains of the same species ?	Homer Simpson
you and me ?	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , yeah , that 's what i meant too . i have no ... inclination ...	Homer Simpson
yep .	Homer Simpson
and she 's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners .	Homer Simpson
wow , this must be important , dad ! i 've never seen you walk up an incline before .	Lisa Simpson
sweetie , i have a very special surprise for you .	Homer Simpson
my bees ?	Lisa Simpson
your bees died days ago . these are their angry , mutant descendants . and they 're tough enough to live in any environment .	Homer Simpson
they sound awfully mad . are they dangerous ?	Lisa Simpson
hm , i 'm not sure . let me check .	Homer Simpson
are you guys dangerous ?	Homer Simpson
a simple `` yes '' would 've sufficed .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , lisa . where else are they gon na go ?	Homer Simpson
to that new stadium that looks exactly like a hive !	Lisa Simpson
oh , they 've found a home .	Lisa Simpson
why do we have to go to the rec center ? i wan na play with my friends !	Bart Simpson
when you 're older , you 'll miss these fun activities .	Homer Simpson
you 're older . why do n't you do these fun activities ?	Lisa Simpson
uh , 'cause no one 's making me . buh-bye .	Homer Simpson
pardon me , master , but what does a big fat wad like you know about kung fu ?	Bart Simpson
do we have any more paints ? my orange is n't the orange of that orange .	Lisa Simpson
lower your expectations , lisa . public program , public program ...	Lisa Simpson
um , excuse me , but i think her painting is very imaginative .	Lisa Simpson
yes , i would . class , everyone please stop and admire juliet 's painting ...	Lisa Simpson

well ... if i pick plain she 'll think i 'm cheap , but if i pick peanut , she may have an allergy . you just killed her , bart !	Lisa Simpson
how about charleston chew ?	Bart Simpson
what is this , brooklyn in the fifties ? do n't just say stuff .	Lisa Simpson
you ask for my help , then you do n't want it .	Bart Simpson
finally , a real suggestion !	Lisa Simpson
if she does n't like coconut , you 're screwed !	Bart Simpson
hi , juliet .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know -- it 's been so long since i 've had a playdate . not that i could n't get one if i wanted ...	Lisa Simpson
does it get you into special exhibits ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's today !	Lisa Simpson
... so lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner ! she 's finally doing something the book said she would !	Marge Simpson
wo n't last .	Bart Simpson
hey mom , can juliet sleep over ?	Lisa Simpson
are your parents okay with that ? they 've never met us .	Marge Simpson
we could be murderers .	Bart Simpson
could 've been . if we had n't had kids .	Homer Simpson
juliet 's father is the world 's foremost john grisham scholar .	Lisa Simpson
toldja , marge . tol . dja .	Homer Simpson
now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom -- i mean , queendom .	Lisa Simpson
equalia . where everyone is equal , but we 're in charge . i mean , somebody has to be , right ?	Lisa Simpson
okay , you two . lights out .	Marge Simpson
lisa ? do you want to be best friends ?	Marge Simpson

my best friend is so cool !	Lisa Simpson
mom , i 'm meeting juliet after school !	Lisa Simpson
great ! here are a few `` best friend '' tips : compliment her hair and shoes . if her dog bites you , do n't make a big deal out of it ... and --	Marge Simpson
friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening . also , if her dog bites you , do n't make a big deal out of it .	Homer Simpson
i just said that .	Marge Simpson
okay , honey . if it 's that important to you , you said it .	Homer Simpson
we 're at the end of chapter four . but we need a grabber , a whammy , a snap-a-roo , some eye mustard ... i 've got it ! how 'bout this ? what if queen helvetica found a rare two-horned unicorn !	Lisa Simpson
i love your accent . two-nicorn . you are definitely doing the book on tape .	Lisa Simpson
and queens valedictoria and helvetica hid their beloved two-nicorn from the hungry ogre homeroni .	Lisa Simpson
now remember , juliet 's family is very classy , so be on your best behavior .	Marge Simpson
use as many big words as possible . i call `` computer . '' bart , you can have `` doorbell . ''	Homer Simpson
nice doorbell . is it computerized ?	Bart Simpson
hey ! that was --	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
we ... i ... you come up with an excuse !	Homer Simpson
ow .	Bart Simpson
if you say so , m'lord .	Homer Simpson
if you 'll show me to your bathroom , i 'd like to pretend to wash my hands .	Homer Simpson
when they make a movie from his books , does he get one , or two free tickets ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll go get her !	Lisa Simpson
hey , could you take a look at a lump on my back ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i get it . here 's ten bucks .	Homer Simpson
what a racket .	Homer Simpson
juliet ? are you okay ?	Lisa Simpson

juliet , you 're scaring me just a little --	Lisa Simpson
a two-nicorn !	Lisa Simpson
these be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs , your majesties .	Marge Simpson
mom , please do n't do that .	Lisa Simpson
who is this `` mom '' of which you speak ?	Marge Simpson
mom , stop ! this is our thing , not yours !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm just trying to --	Marge Simpson
it 's better if you do n't .	Lisa Simpson
well , that 's bart for ya .	Homer Simpson
seems like you and i are always talking about bart , my son .	Homer Simpson
lisa has been seeing an awful lot of her new friend .	Marge Simpson
oh , that . we were actually just going out for brunch and i got lost . but do n't worry , officer . we 'll definitely have a talk with the boy .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't see juliet anymore ? ! i thought you wanted me to have a best friend .	Lisa Simpson
there are limits to how much two people should be together .	Marge Simpson
well , you ca n't keep juliet and me apart ! i 'll ... i 'll disobey !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm bart simpson 's mother . you think you 've got any tricks i have n't seen ?	Marge Simpson
bart simpson , age three .	Marge Simpson
bart simpson , age ten .	Bart Simpson

i 'd love to ! oh , but i 'm supposed to attend the model u.n. this weekend . i 'm the delegate from azerbaijan , and i 'm threatening a rice tariff !	Lisa Simpson
okay ... best friend .	Lisa Simpson
how did you find this place ?	Lisa Simpson
i wonder if lisa has threatened the model u.n. with her rice tariff yet .	Marge Simpson
i doubt it -- friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules .	Homer Simpson
oh hiya , martin ! how 's the model u.n. ?	Marge Simpson
are you saying lisa 's not there ?	Marge Simpson
lisa ran away , and it 's all my fault ! if i 'd just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl , everything would 've been fine .	Marge Simpson
if i know my sister , and unfortunately i do , she probably ran off to some lame-o make-believe castle .	Bart Simpson
a `` castle '' ... i know where they are !	Marge Simpson
wait !	Homer Simpson
is it some place i have to put on a tie ?	Homer Simpson
no !	Marge Simpson
is it a place i 'd look overdressed if i did wear a tie ?	Homer Simpson
you probably would .	Marge Simpson
what about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt ?	Homer Simpson
just go !	Marge Simpson
you know what i think killed this place ? no one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams .	Lisa Simpson
let 's go get my little girl .	Marge Simpson
juliet , i 'm scared .	Lisa Simpson
equalia is not real !	Lisa Simpson
yeah .	Lisa Simpson
so the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow , broad axes poised .	Lisa Simpson
a battle to determine the fate of equalia . but you would n't be interested .	Lisa Simpson
is n't that a little clichã©d ?	Lisa Simpson
yes ! i mean , yes -- there are dragons everywhere ! green ones , chinese ones , chubby bald ones ...	Lisa Simpson
and so the queens --	Lisa Simpson
danced the minuet of equality on a gossamer dewdrop .	Lisa Simpson
looks like . juliet , i do n't want to go to equalia anymore .	Lisa Simpson
it 's a special place , but i need to live in the real world .	Lisa Simpson
goodbye , juliet .	Lisa Simpson
cu-ckoo !	Lisa Simpson
... we have received your manuscript 'the chronicles of equalia ' ...	Lisa Simpson
sounds promising so far !	Marge Simpson
`` ... unfortunately , it is not what we 're looking for at this time . thank you for thinking of us . ''	Lisa Simpson
re-jected !	Bart Simpson
you got a letter all the way from new york city , and that 's something !	Marge Simpson
and you know what else , sweetie ? you and your friend princess nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel , based on my experiences as a dad .	Homer Simpson

homer , that guy 's your age ?	Bart Simpson
no , he 's ten days younger .	Homer Simpson
so you 're saying he 'll look like you in ten days ?	Lisa Simpson
if he 's lucky .	Homer Simpson
the guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he 's god . well , god does n't need his own special day !	Homer Simpson
what about sunday ?	Bart Simpson
sunday 's the lord 's day , boy . not god 's . completely different guy .	Homer Simpson
your father 's just jealous because vance was our class president in high school .	Marge Simpson
if i had won class president , i 'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now .	Homer Simpson
dad , you ran for class president ?	Lisa Simpson
yup -- back in high school , right before i met your mother . a simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation ...	Homer Simpson
do n't feel bad , homie . i married you ! and you 're a million times better than -- here comes vance ! ! !	Marge Simpson
guys that popular and confident are never truly happy .	Homer Simpson
he looks happy .	Bart Simpson
tears of a clown .	Homer Simpson
he 's not crying and he 's not known for clowning .	Lisa Simpson
exception that proves the rule . if losers like me know one thing , it 's that deep down , winners like him are miserable . watch , i 'll prove it .	Homer Simpson
angry nut coming through .	Homer Simpson
hey , vance ?	Homer Simpson

hey !	Marge Simpson
marge , i still would be married to you , but you would just be hotter .	Homer Simpson
dad , just because you won a high school election does n't mean your whole life would have been better .	Lisa Simpson
that 's exactly what it means . and dondelinger took that life away from me . and the taking of a life is murder . and the punishment for murder is ... well , it varies from state to state and by race ... but i 'm gon na find dondelinger and tell him i know what he did last summer ... twenty-two years ago ... in the winter !	Homer Simpson
dondelinger !	Homer Simpson
dondelinger ! i should have been class president , but you stole the election from me .	Homer Simpson
yes ! i want him to know that if your life does n't turn out the way you want , there 's someone else to blame .	Homer Simpson
i already knew that , dad . i 'm gon na blame you .	Bart Simpson
i respect your choice . now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a tom collins .	Homer Simpson
with a virgin tom collins for me ?	Bart Simpson
virgin ? what are you , a girl ?	Homer Simpson
now , dondelinger , i want some answers .	Homer Simpson
you lie . you love me !	Homer Simpson
homie , you 're barely eating .	Marge Simpson

i do n't feel much like eating . i 'll never know what would 've happened if i 'd have been class president .	Homer Simpson
huh ? who said that ?	Homer Simpson
as a rational skeptic , i find that hard to believe . also , as a vegetarian , i hope there 's not meat in that sauce .	Lisa Simpson
no , that 's it .	Lisa Simpson
i see a hair .	Marge Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
i would 've been a winner , instead of some idiot spending his saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce . why did fate do this to me ?	Homer Simpson
why ? why ?	Homer Simpson
come on , stir ! i must see more !	Homer Simpson
homie , please , nothing good will come of this .	Marge Simpson

... debbie pinson .	Homer Simpson
hey , debbie , um ... wan na go to prom with me ?	Homer Simpson
forget it , marge . a girl like you could never land a homer simpson .	Marge Simpson

i got the biggest lapels , the ruffliest shirt , and the most beautiful ... girl ? !	Homer Simpson
debbie , i forgot i have an english paper due on monday . would you read `` to kill a mockingbird '' for me and if you could write down how boo radley fits into the southern gothic tradition , that would be great .	Homer Simpson

sweet dreams .	Homer Simpson
thank you , mysterious weirdo .	Homer Simpson

some friend you are . the minute you become our landlord , you expect us to pay rent . you 'd better just pray i do n't find out where you live !	Homer Simpson
bart ! do n't forget to turn the chicken !	Homer Simpson
yeah , you 'd treat her right .	Homer Simpson
oh , right -- like `` dateline '' did to you !	Homer Simpson
we live in a house that is trying to kill us .	Homer Simpson

i have come from my workshop in the north pole to say : do n't evict the simpsons !	Homer Simpson
it was ... um ... do you have a computer nearby ?	Homer Simpson
he 's nailing something to our door .	Homer Simpson
hm , i wonder if it 's theses .	Lisa Simpson
ew , that 's gross .	Homer Simpson
homie , i think it 's an eviction notice . we 're gon na be homeless , like lucille ball in `` the stone pillow '' !	Marge Simpson
do n't worry , marge .	Homer Simpson
according to this chapter book , we have a secret weapon : `` evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over . '' finally , a practical use for my father .	Homer Simpson
i 'm using you !	Homer Simpson
my own devices !	Homer Simpson
hey , flanders . you ca n't evict us because a senior 's living here now .	Homer Simpson
will you kids knock it off ? i 'm trying to watch badminton !	Homer Simpson
dad , we 've been trapped in the house for days . ca n't we play outside ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , without the sun , my hair 's reverting to its natural red .	Bart Simpson
i do n't want to be called `` rusty '' again ! i do n't !	Bart Simpson
you know , it says here that grampa has to remain in the house , but we do n't . how about a family outing ?	Marge Simpson
family outing ? i 'll start -- lisa 's gay !	Bart Simpson
right , 'cause i would n't want to be gay like my heroes billie jean king , susan sontag , sappho of lesbos , and , i suspect , peppermint patty ...	Lisa Simpson
well , i guess we can take a quick walk . we 'll keep grampa occupied with this dvd of dwight eisenhower talking about golf .	Homer Simpson
so , after i paid for the ice cream cones , i said `` thank you '' and was on my way .	Homer Simpson
we know , dad . we were there .	Bart Simpson
i know it seems that way , because i 'm such a vivid storyteller . now here 's another story called `` bart 's mistake . '' we were walking home when	Homer Simpson
how could this have happened ?	Homer Simpson
well , i ca n't compete with that !	Homer Simpson
oh my god . we 're out on the street !	Marge Simpson
honey , do n't cry . it could be worse -- at least it 's not raining !	Homer Simpson
see , i told you , it 's not raining . so we 're just homeless .	Homer Simpson
kids , if you get lost , remember where we are : seventy-five beds from that wall , and a hundred beds from the crazy guy .	Homer Simpson
i hate this place -- the clothes they gave us are the clothes we gave to charity last year .	Bart Simpson
there 's a lesson here : life is fickle . you should appreciate every ... stop kicking , bart !	Lisa Simpson
but kicking is the only toy i have .	Bart Simpson
that 's not true . you have bug bites you can scratch .	Homer Simpson
this is the lowest we 've sunk .	Lisa Simpson
oh , flanders , i promise i 'll never abuse our friendship again .	Homer Simpson
never ! hooray for stupid flanders !	Homer Simpson
i really hate this neighborhood .	Homer Simpson
yeah , right ! and i 'm married to wonder woman !	Homer Simpson

we have totality , people !	Lisa Simpson
we 'll be talking about this together for years !	Homer Simpson
for years ... for years ...	Lisa Simpson
i finally feel like part of a family !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't miss out ! just one little peek .	Marge Simpson
it 's beautiful !	Marge Simpson
do n't worry , honey , i 'll be your `` seeing-eye homer . '' we 're in some kind of doctor room , bunch of stuff on the walls ... it 's kind of hard to describe ... um , i 'm gon na take my break now .	Homer Simpson
wolves are taking all our women .	Homer Simpson
you guys have treated me like a princess . every day 's been like the first ten minutes of mother 's day !	Marge Simpson
you just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything 's taken care of .	Homer Simpson
dad ! come in the kitchen ! quick !	Lisa Simpson
is there any other way to enter a kitchen ?	Homer Simpson
aw , rats in the kitchen . just like that delightful movie i taped in the theater .	Homer Simpson
ooh , he 's controlling me with my hair , using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots vichy .	Homer Simpson
hmmm , this is good .	Homer Simpson
good , but not great . i 'll go get some rat poison .	Homer Simpson
no , you stupid dog -- that 's maggie 's bunny !	Homer Simpson
not in front of the poison man !	Homer Simpson
whoever 's biting me , stop it !	Homer Simpson
why did i bring the baby and the dog to the poison store ?	Homer Simpson
how am i gon na get us all across this river ?	Homer Simpson
a boat !	Homer Simpson
oh , we 're too heavy .	Homer Simpson
let 's see : i need to get the baby , the dog , and the poison across the river , but i can only take one thing at a time . i ca n't leave the baby alone with the poison , and i ca n't leave the dog alone with the baby .	Homer Simpson
ca n't someone help me with this puzzle ?	Homer Simpson
professor frink ! help me figure this out !	Homer Simpson
yo ! over here !	Homer Simpson
great time to nap , einstein !	Homer Simpson
okay , maggie , dog , poison , you 're all involved , so listen up . first i row maggie over , leaving the dog and the poison . then i row back alone , take the poison over and bring maggie back . then i take the dog over , come back , get maggie , row across , and before i know it , i 'm back at home !	Homer Simpson
were you listening at all ?	Homer Simpson
now , i need to leave you where you 'll be safe ... under the watchful eyes of god . and i 'll be watching you too , in case god 's busy making tornadoes or not existing .	Homer Simpson
i see you ! i see you !	Homer Simpson
i see --	Homer Simpson
catholics !	Homer Simpson
give me my baby back !	Homer Simpson
'cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison . now give her back so i can take her home to my rat-infested house !	Homer Simpson
come on , lady , have a heart . i screwed up ! i 'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes !	Homer Simpson
kids , i have to tell your mom i lost maggie .	Homer Simpson
but dr. hibbert said not to stress her out .	Bart Simpson
wait , i have an idea ! one of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent .	Lisa Simpson
oh no , oh no , ohhh no . there is no way homer simpson 's gon na put on a dress and act like a nun .	Homer Simpson
told you there was no way i would do it .	Homer Simpson
are you sure you do n't want me to do it ? 'cause i can do it . i got the outfit right here .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Homer Simpson
dad , leave -- so i can get into character .	Lisa Simpson
hello . i 'm a poor little sinner who 's lost her way . may i join your order ?	Lisa Simpson
ca n't get enough .	Lisa Simpson
where 's maggie ?	Lisa Simpson
mother superior , are those all the babies in our orphanage ?	Lisa Simpson
no , i was just thinking you might have some in the back you have n't put out yet .	Lisa Simpson
well , more of a curious george .	Lisa Simpson
why would mother superior lie to me about not having maggie ? what is going on ?	Lisa Simpson
a jewel ! why would nuns want a jewel ?	Lisa Simpson
the jewel will lead me to my baby sister ? why are you telling me this ?	Lisa Simpson
goodnight , bart .	Marge Simpson
you mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect ? that 's so cool .	Lisa Simpson
oh sure .	Lisa Simpson
hm ...	Lisa Simpson
quaerite deum in corde et anima . that 's latin ... `` deum '' is god ... and of course `` quaerite '' means `` seek '' ... `` seek god with heart and soul . ''	Lisa Simpson
heart and soul ...	Lisa Simpson
i fell in love with you / heart and soul ...	Lisa Simpson
homie , i have n't held maggie all day . can you hand her to me ?	Marge Simpson
um ... no problem , sweetie .	Homer Simpson
ooo , mommy 's little baby is getting big and chubby ! who 's a chubby baby ?	Marge Simpson
but that does n't mean that you ca n't have a little dinner .	Marge Simpson
hm . you 're not usually this greedy .	Marge Simpson
cool it -- she 's getting suspicious .	Homer Simpson
a cryptic message ! maybe this will lead me to the gem !	Lisa Simpson
hmm , what if i read every other word ? `` one more time , you 're hopeless . try again , numb skull . '' that 's not very nice -- i will try again , but not because the wall told me to . `` turn around . seek springfield 's biggest man-made ring . ''	Lisa Simpson
big ring ... big ring ...	Lisa Simpson
so many rings ! but which one is the key to finding the gem ?	Lisa Simpson
well ? did you get it ?	Lisa Simpson
the biggest ring in springfield ... comes from the bell in the springfield bell tower !	Lisa Simpson
i 'll be right in , lisa !	Marge Simpson
good night , lisa . good ni-ight !	Marge Simpson
oooo , jazz !	Marge Simpson
keep going and i 'll scat .	Marge Simpson
skee-biddy-bob-boo ! dot-doobiddy-dum-doo !	Marge Simpson
ha ! principal skinner ? comic book guy ? what are you doing here ?	Lisa Simpson
oh . well , i seek it so i can find my sister . how do you know about the gem ?	Lisa Simpson
tell me all you know about the gem .	Lisa Simpson
does your mother know you 're using her minivan ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's tonight !	Lisa Simpson
because i cleverly deduced the answer to springfield 's biggest ring . voila !	Lisa Simpson
oh my god . i know what the biggest `` ring '' in `` springfield '' is . it 's been right in front of us the whole time .	Lisa Simpson
mr. burns ! what are you doing here ?	Lisa Simpson
look -- there 's writing on the `` r ! ''	Lisa Simpson
from this angle they 're words !	Lisa Simpson
great ...	Lisa Simpson
crimes ... `` kill '' `` holy '' ... `` sage '' ...	Lisa Simpson
no , that 's not it ! a secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram .	Lisa Simpson
so , the anagram spells : `` regally , the rock gem is ... ''	Lisa Simpson
... lisa ?	Lisa Simpson
does kissing milhouse count ?	Lisa Simpson
it all adds up . i am the gem that will bring world peace ! how brilliant of god to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one !	Lisa Simpson
look who 's here !	Lisa Simpson
oh , fine , fine , finish your song . i can be patient -- after all , i am the gem child .	Lisa Simpson
maggie ?	Lisa Simpson
no , no , no -- the solution was `` regally the rock gem is lisa '' .	Lisa Simpson
um ... this one ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's really maggie , sherlock . you know , i have to point out that this anagram only works if i get the wrong answer first .	Lisa Simpson
maggie -- it 's true ! you are the gem child !	Lisa Simpson
give me my baby back !	Marge Simpson
mom ! how did you know maggie was here ?	Lisa Simpson
a mother knows !	Marge Simpson
maggie , you 're coming home with me !	Marge Simpson
mom , wait ! maggie is the gem child ! she 's brought peace to our town ! and reports of less road rage in shelbyville ! she has to stay here !	Lisa Simpson
well , it would be nice if the first thing i saw was a world at peace ...	Marge Simpson
you 're even more beautiful than i remembered .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry . but i know god would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world ... again .	Marge Simpson
maybe i 'm just being selfish . i do n't know .	Marge Simpson
no , marge . you 're the most giving person i know . besides , i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne .	Homer Simpson
step aside , ladies -- i 'm bringin ' the peace !	Bart Simpson
i am so staying up past my bedtime .	Bart Simpson
a home and garden show ? !	Bart Simpson
mom , you said we were going to a videogame expo !	Bart Simpson
you told me we were gon na pick up trash by the freeway !	Lisa Simpson
you told me something , but i was n't listening !	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry for fibbing . tell you what -- if you do n't like it , you can complain all the way home .	Marge Simpson
fair enough ! kids , let 's practice .	Homer Simpson
mi-mi-mi-miiiii !	Homer Simpson
well that sucked ! / there 's a day we 'll never get back ! / i was so bored .	Lisa Simpson
that was good , but lisa , you 're still complaining from your throat , not your diaphragm .	Homer Simpson
i was so bored !	Lisa Simpson
ooh , look ! a welcome mat that tells you your weight !	Marge Simpson
oh my god . look over there !	Bart Simpson
classic hose-play .	Bart Simpson
what is that soothing sound ?	Marge Simpson
maybe it 's beef stew !	Homer Simpson
hot tubs !	Homer Simpson
guys , what 's it like ?	Homer Simpson
i want to buy your fanciest hot tub !	Homer Simpson
please , can i get it , marge ? please ? please ?	Homer Simpson
i can have all my birthday parties in it !	Bart Simpson

if i 'm more relaxed i 'll be a better mom ! can we ? can we ?	Marge Simpson
wait a minute , who am i pleading with ?	Marge Simpson
beats me . / i'unno . / please , please , please !	Homer Simpson
now i know why lobsters let out that joyful squeal when they 're dropped in the pot .	Bart Simpson
uh-oh . we 're starting to attract swingers .	Marge Simpson
i 'm on it .	Homer Simpson
go back to your day spas !	Homer Simpson
maybe we should get out now .	Marge Simpson
interesting proposal . now with an opposing point of view : bubbles .	Homer Simpson
hey , flanders ! why do n't you join us ? afraid you 'll get your moustache wet ?	Homer Simpson
come on , man . baptize your buns !	Bart Simpson
i feel like we 're forgetting something .	Marge Simpson
hm . there was a note on the fridge marked `` urgent . '' funny word : `` urgent . '' `` urrrgent . '' urgent .	Lisa Simpson
one of us should go look at it .	Bart Simpson
hmm . probably a reminder to relax more .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah . / that 's it .	Bart Simpson
hey , what happened to the bubbles ?	Homer Simpson
sorry we missed your special day , grampa . we 'll definitely go next year .	Lisa Simpson
oh dad , i never knew you had dreams , or emotions .	Homer Simpson
we 'll make it up to you . we 'll do something you 've always wanted to do but never got the chance .	Marge Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa , who said anything about a jar ?	Homer Simpson
okay ... `` pitch in the negro leagues , '' i can think of at least two problems with that ... ca n't read that one , my thumb 's over it ...	Homer Simpson
have one more beer at o'flanagan 's pub ... we 'll do that one !	Homer Simpson
this place is in ireland ? !	Homer Simpson
lousy old man -- makin ' me look up at an airplane !	Homer Simpson
dunkilderry is so quaint ! it looks like the puzzle at the pediatrician 's office .	Lisa Simpson
well , ireland is at the forefront of europe 's tech boom .	Lisa Simpson
in your face , belgium !	Bart Simpson
bart , if you hate belgium so much , maybe i should take your tintins away !	Marge Simpson
no , i 'll be good !	Bart Simpson
this broadcast is from 1979 .	Lisa Simpson

while your father and your grandfather have a drink we 're going to see sights .	Marge Simpson
hey , i just spent ten hours on a plane . i 'm stayin ' here . they 've got german `` krusty '' on tv !	Bart Simpson
such a beautiful language .	Bart Simpson

the giant 's causeway is the result of a volcanic eruption . well kids , is n't that an informational fact ? kids ?	Marge Simpson
come back here !	Marge Simpson
fifty-fifty ?	Lisa Simpson
`` at mcellis island , returning immigrants who are sick of america are processed by irish authorities . ''	Lisa Simpson
they say if you kiss the blarney stone , you get `` the gift of gab . '' which is great , but i 'm not sure i like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing . what kind of a message is that for lisa and maggie ? those are my daughters . but on the other hand , america does n't have any stones worth kissing -- except for stone phillips . do you have one of him here ? if so , he 's our your him .	Marge Simpson
k-i/s-s-m-y/a-s-s spells `` kiss my ass '' !	Bart Simpson
fresh !	Bart Simpson
you okay , dad ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i miss her .	Homer Simpson
well , dad , was there anything on your list about being cheated by an irishman ?	Homer Simpson
hey , boyo -- how about a tall cool one ? how about you , greensleeves ? irishmen love to get drunk .	Homer Simpson
who are you , stuttering fonzie ? what about you , bicycle pants ?	Homer Simpson
why you ...	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
our first sale !	Homer Simpson

yeah , look at 'em crowding the bar ! there 's sully , and mack , jimmy d. and jimmy b. ! what can i get ya , boys -- the usual ?	Homer Simpson
we are so screwed !	Homer Simpson
ooh , it must be bloomsday !	Lisa Simpson
every june sixteenth , lovers of james joyce follow the route traveled by leopold bloom in the novel `` ulysses . ''	Lisa Simpson
hm , let me make a note of that .	Bart Simpson
what you 're saying is we 've run out of fun things to do .	Bart Simpson
pretty much , yeah .	Lisa Simpson
ireland does n't like pubs anymore . it 's as if danish people stopped liking sleek modern design .	Homer Simpson
well , we need help . someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm .	Homer Simpson
moe , something terrible has happened ! the irish have become hardworking and sober !	Homer Simpson
so , what ca n't people do in modern ireland ?	Homer Simpson
people ca n't smoke indoors in ireland !	Homer Simpson
moe , you were right !	Homer Simpson
well , `` da , '' it looks like all your `` der '' have come `` ter . ''	Homer Simpson
i ca n't tell if those are questions or statements .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , dad . we 'll get out . america is the new york yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand .	Homer Simpson
it was apt .	Homer Simpson
let me say i 've always admired the irish . knute rockne , larry bird , and especially mr. potato head .	Homer Simpson
but i ask you , who does smoking actually hurt , except the smokers , those around them , and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on expectant mothers drink free night ?	Homer Simpson
so i hope you 'll forgive two well-meaning americans for trying to take ireland back to the good old days of `` angela 's ashes . '' thank you .	Homer Simpson
oh my god , she fainted ! let 's go get smelling salts !	Homer Simpson
suckers !	Homer Simpson
i want to talk to howard .	Marge Simpson
reverend lovejoy ? you deliver pizza now ? but we did n't order a pizza . but you forgot the pizza anyway . marge , the pizza place screwed up again .	Homer Simpson
like it was yesterday ...	Marge Simpson
kirk and luann split up ...	Marge Simpson
so homer , fearing we would do the same , preemptively filed for divorce ...	Marge Simpson
but then you remarried us , and we were as solid as ever .	Marge Simpson
and i think apu got lucky with my sister .	Marge Simpson
you do n't get it , padre . my old lady and i have a thing goin ' on . we do n't need a piece of paper to keep it real .	Homer Simpson
who are you calling an old lady ?	Marge Simpson
i need that paper quick !	Homer Simpson
so you and mom are n't married ? does that mean i 'm a bastard ?	Bart Simpson
you were born while they were married so legally , no . but in the sense someone calls you one when they 're angry , yes .	Lisa Simpson
it 's not a big deal . we 'll just go to city hall and get married there .	Marge Simpson
i think it 's romantic . you can pretend you 're newlyweds starting a life together .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock .	Bart Simpson
why you little bastard ...	Homer Simpson
that 's the angry one .	Lisa Simpson
this is n't the most romantic place to get married .	Marge Simpson
sweetie , any place i 'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world .	Homer Simpson
marge , this time i 'm going to give you the wedding you deserve . let 's get out of here !	Homer Simpson
hello ?	Marge Simpson
hello . it 's me , lance romance .	Homer Simpson
your first mission is to look out the window .	Homer Simpson
whatever you say , `` lance . ''	Marge Simpson
homer , what 's going on ? the violin , pants with a crease , why ?	Marge Simpson
marge , you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children , was planned in advance . so -- will you marry me -- in style ?	Homer Simpson
oh yes , homer ! yes !	Marge Simpson
did you hear that , santa ? she said yes ! yes ! now , back to your cold , airless tomb .	Homer Simpson
oh , it 's beautiful . but that 's an awful lot to pay for a dress i 'll only wear once .	Marge Simpson
uh ... a princess ?	Marge Simpson
this one 's a little gay , is n't it ?	Bart Simpson
how 'd you check ? !	Homer Simpson
check out this rocket ship cake , marge .	Homer Simpson
that 's for a child 's birthday . we 're going to get this one .	Marge Simpson
maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake . and that would be a big surprise because i 'd forget about it pretty quick .	Homer Simpson
no rockets ! you can pick the frosting .	Marge Simpson
chocolate .	Homer Simpson
we 'll take lemon .	Marge Simpson
okay , i want white roses at the altar , red roses along the aisle , and blue roses in the centerpieces .	Marge Simpson
well , did he take all the blue roses with him ?	Marge Simpson
all right , people , i want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation .	Marge Simpson
what if we ...	Homer Simpson
there is no `` we '' in wedding !	Marge Simpson
but there is , marge ! the first two letters ...	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you 're ruining the second thursday before the wedding !	Marge Simpson
i ca n't believe you told lenny and carl they could bring dates ! 'cause they 're not even coming to the wedding !	Marge Simpson
why not ?	Homer Simpson
because their r.s.v.p . cards arrived one day after the deadline !	Marge Simpson
marge , uh , maybe you should take a break from wedding planning . i think you 're becoming a ... bridezilla .	Homer Simpson
bridezilla ? a combination of bride and godzilla ? how could you say that ? more like you 're a ... king wrong !	Marge Simpson
no matter what i do , marge yells at me . if she 's like this now , what will she be like after we get married ?	Homer Simpson
okay , okay , everyone back off ! i want to see myself .	Marge Simpson
a pimple ! not on my day you do n't !	Marge Simpson
okay , it 's go time .	Marge Simpson
dim the lights .	Marge Simpson
cue the band .	Marge Simpson
and ... release the groom .	Marge Simpson
homer , that 's you !	Marge Simpson
we are now eleven seconds behind schedule !	Marge Simpson
homie ?	Marge Simpson
i ca n't believe homer left me at the altar .	Marge Simpson
what 's going on ? what 's with all the darkness ? hello ? marge ! where am i ?	Homer Simpson
what the ? i 'm chained up like a common bicycle !	Homer Simpson
who would do this to me ? ! it would have to be someone who could afford a chain .	Homer Simpson
but i have to marry marge !	Homer Simpson
just so you know , you 're making a pretty bad first impression .	Homer Simpson
it 's all my fault : homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs . but no . i had to have spring rolls ! they taste like nothing !	Marge Simpson
i do n't understand . dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings . plus he loves mom , and us , yada , yada , yada .	Lisa Simpson
hey , i found something !	Bart Simpson
sideshow bob !	Lisa Simpson
he ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last !	Lisa Simpson
because he knows that if mom and dad do n't get married , i 'll never be born !	Bart Simpson
i 'm afraid i 'm just ... ms. simpson now .	Marge Simpson
i miss you so much .	Homer Simpson
you idiot ! how am i ever going to find the key to the ... ooh , here it is !	Homer Simpson
to get the key i have to lick through a lollipop ? oh , how awful .	Homer Simpson
what the ?	Homer Simpson
whose side are you on ?	Homer Simpson
sideshow bob ! drop that knife and give back our dad !	Lisa Simpson
bob , did you take any breaks yesterday ... to kidnap our dad ?	Bart Simpson
fine . but how do you explain this ?	Lisa Simpson
malge ! ahmiss oo . ahmiss oo so mug ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm gon na say this for the last time : bart , if this is one of your pranks , very funny .	Homer Simpson
what 's fun about fire ants ? they 're -- oh , you 're being sarcastic .	Homer Simpson
thank you , that 's very ... more sarcasm .	Homer Simpson
just see that my fiancã©e marge gets this -- my wedding vows .	Homer Simpson
marge ! moe and maya are here for a double date .	Homer Simpson
marge , i hope this day is as perfect for you , as the day we met was for me . you always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is i. with each marriage i get a little better -- maybe after a thousand , i 'll be worthy of you .	Homer Simpson
i miss you . i miss the kids . god help me , i even miss your sisters .	Homer Simpson
mom ! mom ! we know where dad is !	Lisa Simpson
he 's right here .	Marge Simpson
i 'm not sure what happened . i was kidnapped , then tortured , then i fell into a surprisingly sound sleep . when i awoke , i felt refreshed . then i was blindfolded , and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn .	Homer Simpson
i 'm just happy you 're back . now let 's get that chain off you .	Marge Simpson
wo n't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath ?	Homer Simpson
oh , i 've missed your nonsense .	Marge Simpson

hmm , well , they are good ones .	Lisa Simpson
and to show you how this book works , i will demonstrate on some rats ...	Homer Simpson
let 's try what chapter seven calls `` un-sults '' -- insults disguised as compliments . hey , lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you 're not in the circus .	Homer Simpson
see , it works . and un-sults are just the beginning . there 's also envy-tations , hate-hugs , spamming with faint praise and ... hey everyone , wan na go get frozen yogurt ?	Homer Simpson
ooo , i 'm sorry , moe . i did n't mean everyone everyone . hope you do n't mind .	Homer Simpson
and that , my dear girl , is called the toledo take-back .	Homer Simpson

i see . well , maybe you 're not ready for this book . it is more of a big girl thing .	Homer Simpson
i 'm a big girl ! i 'm a big girl !	Lisa Simpson
one of you said something bad about the other .	Lisa Simpson
we 'd like some balsa wood , please .	Bart Simpson

what 's the hardest model there is ?	Homer Simpson
attention parents , children and childless weirdoes . my son and i are going to build westminster abbey !	Homer Simpson

brittany and kaitlin are here ! where 's my spray-on tan ?	Homer Simpson
ant poison ? why do i always read the labels after ?	Homer Simpson

there are no flights to london till five !	Homer Simpson
yes ! yes ! in your face , losers ! this helicopter is taking off !	Homer Simpson
no ! stop the hovering !	Bart Simpson
i did n't make this terrible model ... my dad did .	Bart Simpson
why ca n't you guys let us do things for ourselves . in the words of oscar wilde : `` experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes . '' i saw him too , dad .	Bart Simpson
i 'm sorry . i got carried away . from now on the only thing i 'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun . but at least i made lisa popular .	Homer Simpson
i h-8 this ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , dad . these girls are nice on the surface , but it 's hard work staying this shallow . i hope you understand .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , it 's clear to me now the best thing i can do as a parent is simply check out .	Homer Simpson
no , there 's a middle ground .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , a light bulb is either on or it 's off .	Homer Simpson
not if you use a dimmer switch .	Lisa Simpson
that 's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think .	Homer Simpson
what 's wrong , homie ?	Marge Simpson
i tried to fix the kids ' lives , but instead i led them to rich and rewarding personal decisions of their own .	Homer Simpson
well , i know a place in this house where you can really relax .	Marge Simpson
that mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar ?	Homer Simpson

the only person getting an education here today was me ! in how bad it is !	Marge Simpson
i want my kids in a decent school !	Marge Simpson
... and because of cutbacks they were combining math with p.e . they were playing dodge book !	Marge Simpson
look at this : springfield elementary 's rating is so low , it 's more than two standard deviations below the norm .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't understand that math reference , because i went to springfield elementary !	Homer Simpson
oh , their school system 's the best . their auditorium and their gym are two different rooms !	Lisa Simpson
we ca n't afford to move to waverly hills ! their house prices have commas in them . as it is , our lawn is just green-painted cement .	Homer Simpson
i just wish i could go to a school like that -- even for one week . `` tis better to have learned and lost then never to have learned at all . ''	Lisa Simpson
what if we got a small apartment there ? we would n't have to live in it , but we would have a waverly hills address .	Marge Simpson
mom , that 's brilliant ! we could go to a school where special does n't always mean bad ! and where the teachers do n't have to moonlight as telemarketers .	Lisa Simpson
wait , wait , wait . you 're putting us in a new school ? ! what about my friends ?	Bart Simpson
oh , elementary school friends -- those are forever ! you 're always gon na be friends with milhouse . stand by me / oh , stand by me ...	Homer Simpson

l'ecole , c'est moi !	Lisa Simpson
even the ralph of this school speaks french !	Lisa Simpson
i love tapas ! it 's like appetizers for a meal that never comes !	Marge Simpson
try the flan de leche de cabra ...	Homer Simpson
be sure to dig around in the gunk .	Homer Simpson
homie ?	Marge Simpson

and i 've got a present for you , but you 'll have to wait till we 're back at the apartment .	Marge Simpson
why ca n't i have it now ? you got your present here . basic fairness dictates ... ... oh !	Homer Simpson
caitlin , hi ! do a reading at your bat mitzvah ? a sheynam dank !	Lisa Simpson

surprise ! i redecorated !	Marge Simpson
where are my videogames ? my x-box ? ! my wii ? !	Homer Simpson
you do n't need a wii now that i 'm here . because you and me make `` us . ''	Marge Simpson
you know , you 're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife .	Homer Simpson
we can talk about that after brunch with my mother .	Marge Simpson
alaska , we 've never met , but everyone thinks i 'm your best friend .	Lisa Simpson
could you ?	Lisa Simpson
you have a show ?	Lisa Simpson
look , can you please , please , help a poor little girl who was just trying to fit in ? it 's what half your songs are about .	Lisa Simpson
what movie ?	Homer Simpson
that 's amazing .	Lisa Simpson
you know , i think those shirts should say `` insecurity . ''	Lisa Simpson
because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt , then i feel sorry for you . do you feel sorry for me ? guess not .	Lisa Simpson
where have you been ? we have mirrors to hang !	Marge Simpson
i went to a movie .	Homer Simpson
without me ? how 'd you get there ?	Marge Simpson
i drove .	Homer Simpson
without me ?	Marge Simpson
sometimes i think this fifty square foot apartment is n't big enough for the both of us !	Homer Simpson
fine ! you can have your key back !	Marge Simpson
i got it halfway -- oh , it went back .	Marge Simpson
hurry ! get out the kids ' stuff !	Marge Simpson
people , i 'm not who you think i am . i 'm just a transfer student who wanted to make some friends . yes , i lied to you , but you only liked me because of a lie . so if you think about it --	Lisa Simpson
thank you , friendo .	Homer Simpson
but , i thought ... you said ...	Homer Simpson
mom ! dad ! i have to leave waverly hills and never come back !	Lisa Simpson
i 've got ta get back , too ! i just remembered i was playing hide and seek with milhouse .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't leave my bachelor pad ! my bros 'll miss me !	Homer Simpson
why do you watch comedies if you do n't want to hear more jokes ?	Homer Simpson
please , i just want to go back to a place where i 'm ostracized for being me , not for who i pretend to be .	Lisa Simpson
what do you think , marge ? maybe we 've outgrown our first apartment .	Homer Simpson
yeah . a house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now .	Marge Simpson
although , i am gon na miss our little love nest .	Marge Simpson
get a room !	Bart Simpson
c'mon , boy ! be cool !	Homer Simpson
but ...	Bart Simpson
be cool or you 're grounded !	Homer Simpson
my daughter 's here for her first mani-pedi .	Marge Simpson
mom , i 'm glad you brought me here , but is n't it more important for a woman to be smart and powerful than beautiful ?	Lisa Simpson
a woman can be smart , beautiful and powerful . like queen elizabeth the first ! she had it all , except the most important thing .	Marge Simpson
please do n't say a man .	Lisa Simpson
no , a husband !	Marge Simpson
the year was 1588 .	Marge Simpson
four hundred years before kirk gibson would hit his famous home run .	Marge Simpson
queen elizabeth ruled over all of england .	Marge Simpson
every eligible bachelor in europe wanted her hand in marriage .	Marge Simpson
lisa , you are going to look so pretty .	Marge Simpson
thank you , but i know a story of a dangerous obsession with female beauty . it 's called `` snow white and the seven ... ''	Lisa Simpson
excuse me , but snow white is a fairytale from hundreds of years ago . no one owns that .	Lisa Simpson
yes . but they 're my own original creation .	Lisa Simpson
there 's crabby ... drunky ... hungry !	Lisa Simpson
... greedy !	Lisa Simpson
... lenny !	Lisa Simpson
... and doc ... tor hibbert .	Lisa Simpson
little did they know , their lives are about to be changed forever by a wicked queen .	Lisa Simpson
so snow white slept and waited for her prince to come ... but he never did .	Lisa Simpson
because a woman should n't have to depend on a man . snow white was brought back to life , by a lady doctor .	Lisa Simpson
and she lived happily ever after ?	Marge Simpson
well , she could n't indulge in strenuous activities like handball , but otherwise she was fine .	Lisa Simpson
that 's nice .	Marge Simpson
marge , i need some bribe money !	Homer Simpson
all i have are some dry-cleaning coupons .	Marge Simpson
thanks , marge . but do n't forget , there 's still gon na be a civil suit .	Homer Simpson
lisa , let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a not-so-great husband .	Marge Simpson
macbeth !	Marge Simpson
out , damn 'd spot ! out , i say !	Marge Simpson
i would n't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role .	Marge Simpson
well , i may be playing a tree but at least i 'm getting my face out there .	Homer Simpson
i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth .	Marge Simpson
hey , there 's no way i could ever be as good as that guy .	Homer Simpson
i think mel would be happier as an understudy . a six-feet-understudy .	Marge Simpson
you 're not suggesting ... murder .	Homer Simpson
wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem , letting `` i dare not '' wait upon `` i would ? ''	Marge Simpson
whatever you say , sweetie .	Homer Simpson
a prop knife !	Homer Simpson
he who laughs last , laughs dead .	Homer Simpson
why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk ?	Homer Simpson
well , if you see him in heaven , tell him he sucks .	Homer Simpson
stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more / by sinel 's death i know i am thane of glamis ... uh , to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow ... today 's tuesday , so that would make it friday , and then , uh ... shakespeare !	Homer Simpson
conrad birdie ? coming here to sweet apple ? !	Homer Simpson
`` dammit , morpheus . not everyone believes what you believe . ''	Homer Simpson
i ca n't wait for the reviews !	Homer Simpson
tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star ... dr. hibbert as banquo ? !	Marge Simpson
who the hell is banquo ?	Homer Simpson
he 's the one getting the good reviews ! which makes him the next one you 've got to kill .	Marge Simpson
would n't it be easier if i just took acting lessons ?	Homer Simpson
screw your courage to the sticking-place and we 'll not fail .	Marge Simpson
that 's inspiring . what 's that from ? x-men 2 ?	Homer Simpson
macbeth !	Marge Simpson
mac-who ?	Homer Simpson
`` in last night 's 'macbeth , ' the best performance was barney gumbel as duncan , followed by duffman as macduff , lenny leonard as lennox , eddie and lou as the two soldiers without lines , then last and least , the lead , homer simpson . ''	Marge Simpson
why do they write a new review of this play every single day ?	Homer Simpson
all i heard was more names of actors you have n't killed . unless you 're not man enough .	Marge Simpson
no , dear . i 'm a man , dear .	Homer Simpson
killing makes me hun-gry	Homer Simpson
eating makes me thirs-ty	Homer Simpson
drinking makes me slee-py	Homer Simpson
why did he have to kill everyone in their costumes ?	Marge Simpson
no , it was homer !	Marge Simpson
no , i just encouraged him .	Marge Simpson
well , at least you ca n't nag me anymore .	Homer Simpson
ow !	Homer Simpson
it 's my moment .	Homer Simpson
to-morrow , and to-morrow , and to-morrow , creeps in this petty pace from day to day , to the last syllable of recorded time . and all our yesterdays have lighted fools . the way to dusty death . out , out , brief candle ! life 's but a walking shadow , a poor player . that struts and frets his hour upon the stage . and then is heard no more .	Homer Simpson
oh homie , you were brilliant . i knew you could do it . i knew it ...	Marge Simpson
now nothing will stop you from taking on all of shakespeare 's greatest roles : king lear ... hamlet ...	Marge Simpson
othello ... richard the third ...	Marge Simpson
henry the fourth , part one ... henry the fourth , part two ...	Marge Simpson
henry the fifth ... titus andronicus ...	Marge Simpson
me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy .	Homer Simpson
that 's it , three stories . that 's what we always tell .	Marge Simpson
looks like maggie wants a story too .	Lisa Simpson
ooo , `` the fountainhead . ''	Marge Simpson
mom , is n't that book the bible of right-wing losers ?	Lisa Simpson
so , anyway , this is the story of maggie roarke , an architect who refused to compromise .	Marge Simpson
maggie 's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others . and i 'm not just saying that 'cause i 'm her mother .	Marge Simpson
but her teacher , mr. ellsworth toohey , wanted every child to conform .	Marge Simpson
he would not let maggie 's creativity flower :	Marge Simpson
goodbye , fat me .	Homer Simpson
i do n't know how you put up with all these kids , toohey . if i were you there 'd be a lot of strangled babies .	Homer Simpson
maggie grew up to be a world-famous architect .	Marge Simpson
her building became one of the wonders of the world .	Marge Simpson
and on the very top floor was a daycare center ...	Marge Simpson
where every child was free to follow their dream . because nothing is ... maggie ! get away from there !	Marge Simpson
bad baby !	Marge Simpson
milhouse , watch me make a loser lose it .	Bart Simpson
excuse me , i just heard that before spider-man was a movie it was a comic book . is that possible ?	Bart Simpson
ooh , twelve cents . i 'll take eight !	Bart Simpson
huh . what 's this ?	Bart Simpson
it was a typical day for delivery man avery mann . until ...	Bart Simpson
you made this ?	Bart Simpson
actually , i like it .	Bart Simpson
have you shown this to anyone ?	Bart Simpson
do n't be afraid of them . they 're just lame-os like yourself .	Bart Simpson
comic book guy 's been writing these for years . who knew a troubled person could be creative ?	Bart Simpson
can you help me out ? i need change for a dollar . oh , i also need a dollar .	Homer Simpson
great ! do you want to see me naked ?	Homer Simpson
let 's go around the table , and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today . lisa ?	Homer Simpson
well , i qualified for the national math bee --	Lisa Simpson
great . okay . marge , go .	Homer Simpson
guess who the garden club elected president ?	Marge Simpson
you ? awesome . next .	Homer Simpson
no . i lost .	Marge Simpson
eh , they can go to hell . bart ?	Homer Simpson
dr. hibbert found out my thyroid is n't pumping out enough --	Bart Simpson
time 's up ! okay , maggie : `` suck , suck , '' that takes us to ... me .	Homer Simpson
some hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie !	Homer Simpson
fine . i 'll give back the oscars i stole from the lobby .	Homer Simpson
do you want the golden globe ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't know if i can . i 'm a yo-yo dieter : `` yo , hot dog man ! '' `` yo , peanuts ! '' why are n't you laughing ? do n't you know what `` yo '' means ?	Homer Simpson
finally , the answer to my problem . what do you do ?	Homer Simpson
hm , they look good with a little meat on their bones .	Homer Simpson
because i 'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments ?	Homer Simpson
yeah , well you do n't always have time to masturbate .	Homer Simpson
oh , that song 's a little on the nose . can we do it to david bowie 's `` heroes ? ''	Homer Simpson
this montage sounds really exhausting . how 'bout i just do a walking around sad montage ?	Homer Simpson
a montage of me turning a ragtag little league team into state runners-up ?	Homer Simpson
me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel , and finally a pickup truck full of chickens ? then i get out of the truck and go thank the driver , but then i see the driver is a chicken ?	Homer Simpson
ten thousand one , ten thousand two ... aaaand fit .	Homer Simpson
was that tobey maguire ?	Homer Simpson
but how will i keep from overeating ?	Homer Simpson
found this on the roof .	Homer Simpson
what 'd you think , kids ?	Homer Simpson
that was awesome !	Bart Simpson
although there were a few holes in the story .	Lisa Simpson
oh , homie ... take your shirt off again .	Marge Simpson
there 's less of you to love , but i love you even more .	Marge Simpson
what was that ? !	Marge Simpson
your other hand .	Homer Simpson
ooh .	Marge Simpson
this life is the greatest . i get paid a fortune , i 've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches , and i get to hire my friends .	Homer Simpson
a lot of things come and go in life . but not fame and fitness .	Homer Simpson
is that all this temporary job was to you : a gig ?	Homer Simpson
but you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants .	Homer Simpson
he 's gone .	Homer Simpson
one cheese cube could n't hurt .	Homer Simpson
oh . this other cheese cube 's stuck to the first one . well , that still technically counts as one .	Homer Simpson
it 's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes .	Homer Simpson
do n't look at me . do n't look at me !	Homer Simpson
you . you watch .	Homer Simpson
well , one thing 's for sure : i 'm not everyman .	Homer Simpson
oh marge ! i 'm ready for some lovin ' !	Homer Simpson
come and get me .	Marge Simpson
marge , speak to me .	Homer Simpson
i think you may have put on a little weight .	Marge Simpson
nag , nag , nag .	Homer Simpson
apu , i have to lose weight now . do you have anything that 'll make me vomit ?	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
how ya doin ' , man ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm right here ! i 've been here all along !	Homer Simpson
what happened is you left ! who did you leave me for ? tell me . i can take it .	Homer Simpson
i knew it !	Homer Simpson
just you and me ?	Homer Simpson
that could work .	Homer Simpson
you just said both those things to me .	Homer Simpson
i 'm so cold .	Homer Simpson
you know , krabappel just needs to chill out and realize life is cool . but how ?	Bart Simpson
okay , now i 'll be the dog and you be the daddy .	Homer Simpson
hmm ... you know , my dad is a lot more fun after a few beers .	Bart Simpson
maybe mrs. k would be nicer if we `` irish '' up her coffee .	Bart Simpson
no , booze . first the easy part : kids , get some liquor .	Bart Simpson
relax . hazelnut creamer covers all sins .	Bart Simpson
you look tired . maybe you need some more coffee .	Bart Simpson
uh-oh . do you think we went too far ?	Bart Simpson
all thanks to ... `` the answer '' !	Bart Simpson
i never wanted her to get fired .	Bart Simpson
maybe i should tell skinner that it was our ...	Bart Simpson
our cell phones !	Bart Simpson
... then zack skyped us , live-blogged our spelling bee , and friended us on facebook !	Bart Simpson
i thought you were studying the lincoln-douglas debates ?	Lisa Simpson
you mean the l-man-d-dog flame wars ?	Bart Simpson
i 'm glad you 've got such a stimulating substitute , but i 'm worried about mrs. krabappel .	Marge Simpson
oh , no worries . i heard on the four-square court she 's doin ' great .	Bart Simpson
no one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip .	Lisa Simpson
oh sure ... it 's sorta on my way home . i can check up on the old girl . she probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school .	Bart Simpson
mrs. k ? is everything all right ?	Bart Simpson
it 's the movie . it 's so funny .	Bart Simpson
sorry . sorry .	Bart Simpson
mrs. k. , you 've got ta get outta here . when was the last time you washed your hair ?	Bart Simpson
well , that 's better than me . but still , you 've got ta get out .	Bart Simpson
okay look , there 's a big football game on tonight , so we can get this thing over real quick . show me some of bart 's artwork , give me a little false hope , and here 's a little something to help with his grades .	Homer Simpson
i 'm not asking for a 's . just incompletes .	Homer Simpson
it will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this .	Homer Simpson
i said , are there any areas that we , his parents , can improve upon ?	Homer Simpson
you 're the first teacher that ever got me .	Homer Simpson
milhouse ... we ruined edna 's life . maybe we can get her job back .	Bart Simpson
there 's got to be some other way to help mrs. k .	Bart Simpson
bookstores do n't have answers . they just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways .	Bart Simpson
what 's `` the answer ? ''	Bart Simpson
so , um , you 're wearing the same bathrobe you were the last time i was here . that 's cool .	Bart Simpson
well , mrs. k. i have just the book slash dvd for you . `` the answer . ''	Bart Simpson
this book uses the ancient power of wanting .	Bart Simpson
hey ... `` just because we do n't understand electricity , does n't mean we ca n't enjoy its benefits . ''	Bart Simpson
cut it out . you 're not a teacher anymore .	Bart Simpson
look , mrs. k , i 'm a simpson . and a simpson never gives up until he 's tried at least one easy thing . let me help you .	Bart Simpson
so , did you write your dream on the index card of fate ?	Bart Simpson
i want to own a muffin store . great idea ! now let 's see ...	Bart Simpson
`` break your dream down into smaller 'wishes , ' then break those down into 'wish-able actions . ' ''	Bart Simpson
loony ? would a loony self-help book come with a magic question mark inside ?	Bart Simpson
eh ? eh ? eh ?	Bart Simpson
nothing , nothing .	Bart Simpson
my pleasure .	Bart Simpson
beats me , i just gave him a banana .	Bart Simpson
yep . i 'm off the hook now .	Bart Simpson
well , i guess i can tell you ... 'cause everything worked out for the best ...	Bart Simpson
well , it 's funny , really . i 'm the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired .	Bart Simpson
please do n't kill me .	Bart Simpson
but this place was your dream !	Bart Simpson
noooo !	Bart Simpson
but-but-but , you found `` the answer ! ''	Bart Simpson
nooo ! i wrote a phone number in there !	Bart Simpson
dad ... am i bad on the inside ?	Bart Simpson
no ... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center .	Homer Simpson
but you think there 's like a kernel of good inside me , right ?	Bart Simpson
hm , i do n't know -- kernels are kind of big .	Homer Simpson
listen ... i was thinking ... if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher ... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back , would it be okay ?	Bart Simpson
when you say `` teacher , '' do you really mean `` parent ? ''	Homer Simpson
no , i mean teacher .	Bart Simpson
great . go nuts . but remember , we never had this discussion .	Homer Simpson
what discussion ?	Bart Simpson
the one we just had about you doing bad things , you stupid kid ! ohhh .	Homer Simpson
... so you see , it was my fault . i got mrs. krabappel drunk . and then i was gon na do the same thing to zack , but i decided it was better to just tell the truth .	Bart Simpson
does n't matter , as long as edna gets her job back .	Bart Simpson
i did n't . i swear !	Bart Simpson
and there 's no hard feelings ?	Bart Simpson
but it 's stale .	Bart Simpson
yes !	Marge Simpson
i googled `` girls having fun , '' and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn , i found `` crazy bowling . ''	Marge Simpson
that 's odd . there is n't a single man in this whole bowling alley .	Marge Simpson
woo hoo ! there 's no better violence than self-inflicted violence !	Homer Simpson
thanks for bringing me here , dad . i 'll remember this day on my deathbed .	Bart Simpson
not everyone has a deathbed , son -- you could die suddenly .	Homer Simpson
whoa . maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang .	Bart Simpson
maybe .	Homer Simpson
ask him .	Homer Simpson
sir , could you sign my program with a swear word ?	Bart Simpson
ah yes , filthy , but obscure . with a subtle scatological undertone .	Homer Simpson
pay the man , boy .	Homer Simpson
now listen , son , i know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight , but remember : do n't try this at home . do it at the schoolyard . someplace where , if you get hurt , we can sue , not just them , but the school , the county , the state , and that jackass joe biden .	Homer Simpson
where 's your brother ?	Marge Simpson
i dunno -- chasing ducks ? buried alive ? he 'll be missed . let 's move . i 've got ta collect pine cones .	Lisa Simpson
just follow the `` dies , '' mom .	Lisa Simpson
bart simpson ! i 'm glad your father is n't here to see this !	Marge Simpson
kill ! kill . kill .	Homer Simpson
bart , let him go !	Marge Simpson
but mom , i 'm winning ! look at this ! his lunch money !	Bart Simpson
god did n't give you legs so you could use them as scissors !	Marge Simpson
i was just doing the moves i learned from ultimate punching !	Bart Simpson
ultimate punching ? ! `` ultimate '' makes everything worse !	Marge Simpson
otto , do n't you have a sack to hacky ?	Marge Simpson
okay , i 'm going to put a stop to this `` ultimate punching . ''	Marge Simpson
uh-huh ...	Marge Simpson
uh-huh ...	Marge Simpson
what else ?	Marge Simpson
nelson , you really have a knack for this .	Marge Simpson
maybe someday you can do lisa 's wedding !	Marge Simpson
this goes on for a while ...	Marge Simpson
call me a killjoy , but i think that because this is not to my taste , no one else should be able to enjoy it .	Marge Simpson
mom , do n't do this ! this sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you !	Bart Simpson
tell her , dad ! you love ultimate punching even more than i do !	Bart Simpson
ultimate punching is exploitative , violent and a bad influence on our young people . studies have shown your mother is right .	Homer Simpson
what the ?	Bart Simpson
chocolate , whipped cream ... cherries ! she got to you ! with a piece of black forest cake !	Bart Simpson
it was n't just a piece -- it was the whole cake ! frosting ... like snow ... on the eaves of a bavarian castle !	Homer Simpson
glad you did n't come cheap .	Bart Simpson
i could n't help it ! she knew my one weakness -- that i 'm weak !	Homer Simpson
five , six / who 's got tix ?	Homer Simpson
we need to take this into the belly of the beast . mr. scalper , give me a ticket .	Marge Simpson
i 'm marge simpson and i will not rest until you tear down this septagon !	Marge Simpson
pleased to meet you , chett .	Marge Simpson
guys , please . when you yell like that , no one can hear me .	Marge Simpson
chett , i 'm here to ask you one simple thing : please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity .	Marge Simpson
at least in other sports they 're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone . but in this sport they do n't put anything in anything . and if they did , i would n't want to see it !	Marge Simpson
really ?	Marge Simpson
what ? that 's crazy .	Marge Simpson
that flattens my soda pop ! you 're on !	Marge Simpson
what 'd i miss ?	Homer Simpson
nothin ' .	Bart Simpson
mom , you ca n't fight that guy .	Bart Simpson
yeah , marge . he 'll knock your block off . your beautiful block .	Homer Simpson
thank you , homie .	Marge Simpson
listen : of all the crazy things i 've ever done , this is the craziest . and you 're doing it .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't back out . this is for a cause that 's bigger than i am . if gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie , i can do this . besides , i 'm a woman . he 'll probably go easy on me .	Marge Simpson
or kick the crap out of you .	Bart Simpson
watch your language , moron .	Homer Simpson
if i 'm gon na open a can of whup-tushy , i 'd better get in shape , with some rhythmic gymnastics !	Marge Simpson
someone 's got ta stop her from going through with this fight . this goes against every feminist bone in my body , but dad , ca n't you control your woman ?	Lisa Simpson
how can i control her ? ! i have nothing to withhold !	Homer Simpson
oh man , now she 's writing cutesy things with the ribbon .	Bart Simpson
we 've got ta get marge some professional training . carl , do you know heavyweight champ drederick tatum ?	Homer Simpson
well , i ... uh ...	Homer Simpson
`` beat , slay , shove . ''	Marge Simpson
i 'll bash him with this book !	Homer Simpson
is he okay ?	Marge Simpson
listen ... i 'm late for a p.t.a . meeting .	Marge Simpson
marge ... i bet we 've got ten minutes till the kids wake up .	Homer Simpson
`` eat , pray , love . ''	Marge Simpson
is there someone in there ?	Marge Simpson
someone should tell your principal !	Marge Simpson
mom , i came here to tell you it 's not too late to back out .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't back out , because if i fight him tomorrow ... it 'll be a less-violent world for you kids in the future .	Marge Simpson
there must be a better way .	Lisa Simpson
there certainly is .	Homer Simpson
marge simpson reporting for duty !	Homer Simpson
dad , i keep telling you , that wo n't work .	Lisa Simpson
uh , moe , i have a confession to make : i 'm just homer dressed as marge .	Homer Simpson
well , you 'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night .	Homer Simpson
marge , i tried my best to talk you out of this . but since you 're going through with it , i beg you , just stay out of his way and do n't get hurt .	Homer Simpson
and mom , if you punch him in the junk , you 'll get no disrespect from me .	Bart Simpson
hey bart , did you know that 's a haiku ?	Lisa Simpson
nobody needs to know that ! skip ahead !	Marge Simpson
i knew it !	Marge Simpson

woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
tap out ! do n't make me break your arm !	Marge Simpson
really ? oh , thank you .	Marge Simpson
okey-doke .	Marge Simpson
i 'd just like to say one thing . i only agreed to this fight because i wanted to stop the violence . and sure i got into great shape and met some fun people , but i ended up discovering my own dark side . so from now on , the only thing i 'm fighting is this cold i 'm coming down with .	Marge Simpson
mom , that 's a beautiful thought .	Bart Simpson
well , i wish somebody would 've stuck around to hear it .	Marge Simpson
where did they all go ?	Marge Simpson
two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch .	Lisa Simpson
ooo , ooo , can i go , marge ? can i ? can i ?	Homer Simpson
no . let 's go home . we can enjoy some mixed `` marital '' arts .	Marge Simpson
no holds barred .	Homer Simpson
hey , lis .	Bart Simpson
yeah ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know when we 'll be in a septagon again . wan na settle this bad blood that 's been going on between us since you were born ?	Bart Simpson
you 're on .	Lisa Simpson
congratulations , hubert . or should i congratulate your tutor : amelia , at the homework factory ! your victory is tainted ! asterisk ! asterisk !	Lisa Simpson
asterisk ! asterisk ! asterisk !	Lisa Simpson
stupid miss hoover .	Lisa Simpson
i heard about your run-in with hoover . are n't teachers the worst ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't want to talk about it .	Lisa Simpson
listen , you 're a smart kid . i bet you like ideas .	Bart Simpson
i do .	Lisa Simpson
well , i just had a whopper ! what if you got revenge on krabappel for me , and i got revenge on hoover for you ? crisscross !	Bart Simpson
interesting . with no obvious motive , no one would suspect us .	Lisa Simpson
exactly . crisscross ! do we have a deal ?	Bart Simpson
thanks ... but i 'll pass .	Lisa Simpson
if i say `` crisscross '' one more time , will that change your mind ?	Bart Simpson
listen , you 're a persistent fellow , but i --	Lisa Simpson
crisscross !	Bart Simpson
i 'm in .	Lisa Simpson
bart , have you established your alibi ?	Lisa Simpson
yep . i 'm at the tennis match .	Bart Simpson
and people will remember you were there ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm pretty sure they will .	Bart Simpson
crisscross .	Lisa Simpson
you should 've seen the look on krabappel 's face !	Lisa Simpson
and you should 've seen the look on hoover 's face . in fact , here it is .	Bart Simpson
you killed her ?	Lisa Simpson
right . like we agreed .	Bart Simpson
i never said `` kill ! ''	Lisa Simpson
yeah , 'cause you 're smart . you do n't say `` kill , '' you say `` prank . '' like mom and dad say `` snuggle '' when what they really mean is `` let 's lock the door and hug . ''	Bart Simpson
well , i did n't kill mrs. krabappel !	Lisa Simpson

you heard sirens , which you thought were the police coming to arrest you . to ditch their stills ... the moonshiners pushed them down a hill . the moonshine landed in a river , temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it .	Lisa Simpson
that river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town 's tap water also go temporarily blind .	Lisa Simpson
moonshine in the water ? i 'll be the judge of that .	Homer Simpson

two kid 's tickets for `` the diversity kittens . ''	Bart Simpson
... and murder and swears and brains and basements ...	Bart Simpson

i 've been waiting for this day for so long . the year is nineteen forty-six . in a war-torn world , a single flower blooms . and that flower is an angry japanese monster named godzilla . how am i doin ' , dad ?	Homer Simpson
fortunately there was one man who could help : colonel tom parker . the colonel took this monster , cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name `` the rolling stones . '' the first concert was a sellout , with many , many , many people eaten . but those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen .	Homer Simpson
time to try out my new deep fryer .	Marge Simpson
... and that lasted about five years . but then godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies . all of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist .	Homer Simpson
/ hilarious !	Bart Simpson
i do n't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other .	Marge Simpson

none for me , marge . i get free donuts at work ! i can see them now ... in the break room , beside the fridge , the pink cardboard box awaits ...	Homer Simpson
... groaning with a `` united nations '' of donuts : jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled , the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves ...	Homer Simpson

they took away our donuts at work ! all i 've had are my meals !	Homer Simpson
i guess these days headhunters can be anything .	Homer Simpson
you nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are . times have never been better for your industry , now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin ' .	Homer Simpson

i am her / she is me / i 'm just like / penelope ...	Lisa Simpson
it 's still on / in my head / it will be there till i 'm dead ...	Lisa Simpson
whether she 's competing in equestrian events at the 1976 olympics or spending her summers at holyrood palace , princess anne is truly a world leader .	Lisa Simpson
thank god .	Bart Simpson

that 's it -- game over .	Bart Simpson

wait , here comes the `` mykeeyah . ''	Bart Simpson
ooh , family trees -- the charts representing genealogical relationships in a branching structure !	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't wait to see what noble branches lie in the simpson family foliage !	Lisa Simpson
no , this ca n't be right .	Lisa Simpson
they 're all horrible !	Lisa Simpson
yeah , the simpson family is a long line of horse thieves , deadbeats , horse beats , dead thieves , and even a few ...	Homer Simpson
alcoholics .	Homer Simpson
there must have been some good ancestors -- grampa , do n't you know any ?	Lisa Simpson
listen , lisa . you 're gon na find more than you bargained for . if i were you , i would n't dig into the past . i lived in some of that past , and i got out for a reason .	Homer Simpson
i wo n't give up . i have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the pittsburgh poisoners , this family had a noble spark . and i will find it , even if i have to go back to adam and eve .	Lisa Simpson
well , are you gon na help me or what ?	Lisa Simpson
thank you .	Lisa Simpson

this entry 's dated april 14th , 1860 .	Lisa Simpson
i warn you : i do n't know what 's in there but if it 's about a simpson , you ai n't gon na be proud .	Homer Simpson
oh stop -- it 's the journal of a sweet little girl ! keep reading , honey .	Marge Simpson
`` dearest diary , today i am the happiest girl in springfield -- ''	Lisa Simpson
see . all good .	Marge Simpson
`` ... because tomorrow , i shall get my very first slave . ''	Lisa Simpson

homer !	Marge Simpson
read a little more , honey .	Marge Simpson
`` saturday , april 14 , 1860. dear diary , i must be brief , for tonight is the grand ball ... ''	Lisa Simpson
that 's all there is -- the rest of the diary has turned to dust !	Lisa Simpson
yes !	Lisa Simpson
she was n't a slave owner ! our family was on the underground railroad !	Lisa Simpson
we ran a subway station ?	Bart Simpson
no , the `` underground railroad '' was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to canada . there were no actual trains , and it was n't under ground .	Lisa Simpson
then they should 've called it the `` above-ground normal-road . ''	Bart Simpson
good point , bart .	Homer Simpson
absolutely right .	Marge Simpson
i never thought of that before .	Lisa Simpson
very good , bart .	Marge Simpson
that 's a great story , lisa ! and you should stop reading right there .	Homer Simpson
what are you doing ? i wan na know what happens next .	Lisa Simpson
well i do n't . the motto of the simpsons is , `` quit while you 're ahead . ''	Homer Simpson
i made it into a sampler !	Marge Simpson
it 's like when your father and i left the movie `` carrie '' right after she was crowned prom queen ! she was so happy -- she 'd had a lot of problems , but they were all behind her !	Marge Simpson
but-but-but-but-but ...	Lisa Simpson
time for bed , sweetie .	Homer Simpson
i must know !	Lisa Simpson
you still reading that thing ? i 'm warning you : when something goes into that vent , it should n't come out . ever !	Homer Simpson
well i am reading it , and when i 'm finished , i 'm going to use eliza 's diary for my `` black history month '' presentation !	Lisa Simpson
ooh , good idea . bart , what are you doing for black history month ?	Marge Simpson
i got an idea : you can march to selma -- and tell her she 's ugly !	Homer Simpson
listen : `` april 20th , 1860. a week ago , i had no idea what the future would bring , which , i guess , is always true of everyone all the time . anyway , last saturday night , i went to colonel burns 's ball ... ''	Lisa Simpson
run !	Lisa Simpson
what happened next ?	Marge Simpson
i 'll never know if eliza got virgil safely to freedom !	Lisa Simpson
cheer up , sweetie . maybe we can find the answer in the library !	Marge Simpson
to the reference desk !	Lisa Simpson
the library ? bart , can you believe we 're married to those nerds ?	Homer Simpson
oooh , a cookbook !	Marge Simpson
that 's eliza 's mother !	Lisa Simpson
martha , you are the best .	Lisa Simpson
`` pork butt in cream , '' `` snout-fried neck , '' `` frog haunch , '' `` hooves au jus , '' `` possum pouch pie ... ''	Marge Simpson
please do n't make those recipes .	Lisa Simpson
this one does n't sound roadkill-y . and , it comes with a story . `` many years ago , my daughter , eliza , brought a runaway slave , virgil , to the house ... ''	Marge Simpson
they made it back to the house ? ! how ? !	Lisa Simpson
the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil ... , the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil,9	Marge Simpson
luckily they chanced upon a traveling circus ...	Marge Simpson
... where they were helped by a crusty old clown .	Marge Simpson
wait . all that was in the recipe ?	Lisa Simpson
it was a footnote . see ?	Marge Simpson
`` anyway , i was very proud of eliza , but my husband hiram had not quite caught abolition fever ... ''	Marge Simpson
so they did the right thing -- my quest is fulfilled ! our family has heroes !	Lisa Simpson
our family has heroes !	Lisa Simpson
my black history month presentation is called `` the simpsons : the first family of freedom . ''	Lisa Simpson
no , no , no , not now ! quit ! quit ! no , do n't quit the program , just the update , ya stupid --	Lisa Simpson
computers , right ? our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named eliza simpson .	Lisa Simpson
the year was 1860 , and the underground railroad was ...	Lisa Simpson
... and though hiram , mabel , and eliza are no longer among us , their truth goes marching on . thank you .	Lisa Simpson
what are you talking about ?	Lisa Simpson
no ! you lie ! eliza simpson ca n't be a coward ! she 's the only decent ancestor i have .	Lisa Simpson
leave me alone ! i have shares to crop !	Homer Simpson
but i need to prove that my ancestor could n't have backed down to colonel burns !	Lisa Simpson
huh ?	Lisa Simpson
there 's no noble simpson .	Lisa Simpson
you were right , dad . i should have quit while i was ahead , instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and virgil .	Lisa Simpson
what are you talking about ? is there something you know about virgil that you have n't told us ?	Lisa Simpson
listen , wrinkles ! if you know something that 'll cheer up my little girl , you 'd better spill it . or i can make things very uncomfortable for you .	Homer Simpson
about virgil .	Homer Simpson
yes ! i 'm thrilled ! we 've regained our family honor and we 're one-sixty-fourth black !	Lisa Simpson
so that 's why i 'm so cool !	Bart Simpson
that 's why my jazz is so smooth !	Lisa Simpson
and that 's why i earn less than my white co-workers !	Homer Simpson
grampa , why 'd you try to keep us from finding this out ?	Lisa Simpson
racists ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know what the big deal is . i mean , it never bothered any of you that my father 's french . you know , bouvier ?	Marge Simpson
so that 's why i love drinking so much .	Homer Simpson
i 'm french , not you .	Marge Simpson
c'est la vie , baby .	Homer Simpson

one month ? that 's a heavy workload for a fourth grader .	Marge Simpson
i say this boy needs more homework .	Homer Simpson
i do n't have to do it with him , do i ?	Homer Simpson

oh my ! a child who does n't enjoy school ? hello ? hollywood ? ! you want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story ? a million dollars ? deal ! now i have to write it .	Homer Simpson
wow , how does this show stay so fresh ?	Bart Simpson
hey ! you 're supposed to be doing your homework ! no more tv for you !	Homer Simpson
until your homework is done , the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair .	Homer Simpson
it 's okay , bart . just do a couple vocabulary words , then come have some milk and cookies .	Marge Simpson
but dad said i had to finish --	Bart Simpson
never mind what he said . you just listen to me .	Marge Simpson
hey lis . mom and dad just told me two different things . how is that possible ?	Bart Simpson
well , sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about . in politics it 's called a `` wedge issue '' -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage .	Lisa Simpson
wait a minute . can i play them against each other so i do n't have to do any homework at all ?	Bart Simpson
you would mess up mom and dad 's marriage just to get out of doing some homework ?	Lisa Simpson
hey , hey , i would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions .	Bart Simpson
fractions are n't that hard , you just have to find a common denominator . for example : one half plus one third equals ...	Lisa Simpson
end . all . life . on . this . planet .	Bart Simpson
you 'll need to know fractions to make that explosion !	Lisa Simpson
so much homework ... childhood slipping away ...	Bart Simpson

yeah , right .	Homer Simpson
hey , why are n't you doing your homework !	Homer Simpson

well do n't be wrong in front of our son !	Homer Simpson

because when you get down to it , are n't all religions the same ? they tell you what to eat , when to pray ... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine . but we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other .

it 's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons . lamp , computer , jacob 's ladder ...	Homer Simpson
how long has this been running ?	Homer Simpson
dad , while i agree reducing consumption is great , it 's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle .	Lisa Simpson
are you calling me fat ?	Homer Simpson
no ... i am suggesting you consider cheaper , alternate sources of energy .	Lisa Simpson

it 's making our meter run backwards !	Marge Simpson
oh my goodness ! it means we 're traveling back in time ! i can warn president lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy !	Homer Simpson

oh . well i 'm not crawling back to big electricity ! from now on , the simpsons are living intermittently .	Homer Simpson
my smoothie is a lumpy !	Marge Simpson
the wind may have stopped working , but my brain nev ... er does . check it out , gang .	Homer Simpson
but dad , it defeats the purpose if you 're powering our windmill with the electricity from flanders .	Lisa Simpson
but we have n't read the minutes of last week 's meeting !	Homer Simpson
you used to be nicer !	Homer Simpson
when is my turn over ?	Bart Simpson
bart , please ! i 'm trying to hear dr. house 's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis !	Lisa Simpson
dear lord , you 've got the wind i need , i 've got the prayers you crave . let 's make a deal .	Bart Simpson
now we 're cookin ' with wind !	Homer Simpson
homie , maybe this is too much electricity .	Marge Simpson
nothing is ever right for you .	Homer Simpson

a little .	Lisa Simpson
homie , i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic . it usually does not end well .	Marge Simpson
we ca n't let lisa get her hopes up .	Marge Simpson
marge , how hard can it be ? we 're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach . it 's not like it 's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a mexican prison .	Homer Simpson
ooh , it 's dinner time !	Homer Simpson
but that would make a great movie .	Homer Simpson
lisa is very sensitive . if something she loves dies in front of her --	Marge Simpson
that whale 's not gon na die ! we 're busting him out of prison , no matter what you say , escobar ! god , this thing writes itself .	Homer Simpson
coming !	Homer Simpson
okay , we 'll need the town 's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water .	Homer Simpson
hm . we need a better idea . we 'll have to find the town 's smartest men .	Homer Simpson
it 's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart .	Lisa Simpson
one , two , three , tug !	Homer Simpson
lisa , sweetheart -- it 's almost dinnertime . why do n't you come home ?	Marge Simpson
i 'll catch up with you guys in a little bit .	Lisa Simpson

bluella ?	Lisa Simpson
oh no .	Lisa Simpson

oh lisa , i 'm sorry . i tried my best . i know it 's really hard when you discover your dad is n't perfect .	Homer Simpson
not perfect ? ! you can say that again .	Bart Simpson
i 'm trying to be a sensitive father , you unwanted moron ! lisa , where were we ?	Homer Simpson
maybe i should just be alone a little bit .	Lisa Simpson
of course .	Homer Simpson
it kills me to see her like that . and if there 's one thing i ca n't stand it 's being killed .	Homer Simpson
milhouse , this 'll be the biggest dead animal we ever poked with a stick !	Bart Simpson
now , lisa , i know you miss your whale . so i got you a pet that will never die . an invisible dog .	Homer Simpson

i 'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store ! get in !	Homer Simpson
shark week just got cancelled .	Homer Simpson
oh come on ! leave me alone ! i 'm trying to save your precious whales !	Homer Simpson
you like sharks ?	Homer Simpson
typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk !	Homer Simpson
dad , no !	Lisa Simpson
they 're right . if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature , i ca n't let you do it .	Lisa Simpson
sharks , innocent ? please . every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things . the shark 's reptilian brain understands only one thing : the crime of murder ...	Homer Simpson
dad ! the sharks must think you 're a baby whale !	Lisa Simpson
ooh , a baby whale . my diet is working .	Homer Simpson
ooh , maybe the blood will scare the sharks off !	Homer Simpson
it 's the baby whales ' dad !	Lisa Simpson
thanks , buddy !	Homer Simpson
thanks for not letting me give up , dad .	Lisa Simpson
hey , i 'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal , by which i mean you .	Homer Simpson
do you think they 'll be okay ?	Lisa Simpson
absolutely . he 's young , he 's got two cute kids ... he 'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time . they 'll have to sell their old place ... too many memories . but if i 'm not mistaken , there 's a little whale-a-puss on the way .	Homer Simpson
tonight let 's all draw pictures of what your father just said .	Marge Simpson
i want some of that !	Homer Simpson
guess what company had a giveaway at moe 's last night ?	Homer Simpson
no . i wo n't .	Bart Simpson
keep guessing ...	Homer Simpson
what 's it say , boy ?	Homer Simpson
responsibly .	Bart Simpson
hey !	Lisa Simpson
that 's not true ! first of all , milhouse fell because you tripped him . secondly , `` spaz '' is short for `` spastic diplegic , '' someone who suffers from a serious medical condition . thirdly , your `` haw haw , '' through overuse , has lost its power .	Lisa Simpson
well , i am one : flattered and two : intrigued . lisa simpson .	Lisa Simpson
i did n't know we had a debate team .	Lisa Simpson
... and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers .	Lisa Simpson
initially yes , but --	Lisa Simpson
currently . however , solar and wind are ...	Lisa Simpson
blondie ?	Lisa Simpson
first of all , my father no longer has any functioning credit cards . secondly , how dare you refer --	Lisa Simpson
i ... i ...	Lisa Simpson
mmmm . good mac and cheese .	Homer Simpson
i 'll have to check it out sometime .	Homer Simpson
mmm .	Homer Simpson
i am pretty full .	Homer Simpson
i 'm on my way !	Homer Simpson
does he have a cute accent ?	Marge Simpson
oooh , he sounds just like paddington bear !	Marge Simpson
excuse me ! is this what the framers of the constitution would want ?	Lisa Simpson
how many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security ?	Lisa Simpson
again with the blonde ! why in the world would the color of the hair on someone 's head have anything to do with the intelligence within ?	Lisa Simpson
i ha --	Lisa Simpson
lisa , i know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair , so i got you this book from the `` being different '' section of the bookstore .	Marge Simpson
sally circle was eating donuts and ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news .	Lisa Simpson
everyone was mean to sally . she was too well-rounded . she felt cornered . they would n't let her play four-square or invite her to the box social .	Lisa Simpson
the end .	Lisa Simpson
that 's a rather unambitious book .	Lisa Simpson
he sure nailed you , lis .	Bart Simpson
you 're blond too .	Lisa Simpson
blonde guys are n't dumb . they 're evil . like in `` the karate kid '' and world war two .	Bart Simpson
what is it , ned ?	Marge Simpson
should we inform the chief ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't know ... i 'm starting to think we 're prying too much into people 's lives , and this room is n't really the best place for maggie to hang out .	Marge Simpson
that 's not sesame street , that 's a gay bar .	Marge Simpson
although i guess this would teach her sharing and caring , but ... we 're going home .	Marge Simpson
dye ! dye ! dye !	Lisa Simpson
golf ball-sized hail !	Homer Simpson
woo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
/	Homer Simpson
all right ! all right !	Homer Simpson
i 'm goin ' home . it 's not safe in here .	Homer Simpson
so you like to watch , huh ? ! well , take a look at this !	Bart Simpson
whoa , a blind spot !	Bart Simpson
hey boy , whatcha doing ?	Homer Simpson
experimenting with my butt .	Bart Simpson
my little einstein .	Homer Simpson
welcome to chaos corners , the pleasure patch , satan 's triangle ... the one place in town no cameras can see you and no laws can touch you !	Bart Simpson
a phony bird call ? ! that means marge is coming ! everyone , act legal !	Homer Simpson
homer , maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween . what 's going on ?	Marge Simpson
well , uh ... the one place the cameras ca n't see is right here in our backyard so i 'm charging people to do whatever they want -- is n't that wonderful ?	Homer Simpson
i do n't see what 's so wonderful .	Marge Simpson
remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation ? well , now i can afford a motorcycle !	Homer Simpson
ever hear of the expression `` not in my backyard ? '' well , that !	Marge Simpson
i do n't want to get homer in trouble , but it 's just plain wrong to use that blind spot to turn our back yard into a mecca of misdemeanors !	Marge Simpson
dressing in uniforms is a good thing -- if everyone looks the same , it levels the playing field .	Lisa Simpson
it 's better to just fit in with the crowd .	Lisa Simpson
oh , i ca n't go on ! this rebuttal is a sham !	Lisa Simpson
you are n't being persuaded by the content of my argument -- you 're being convinced by the color of my hair !	Lisa Simpson
well guess what , i am not a brunette ! i 'm a blonde !	Lisa Simpson
we must rid ourselves of these outdated clichã©s . not all blondes are dumb ! not all fat people are jolly .	Lisa Simpson
and not all old people are bad drivers !	Lisa Simpson
who wants feet steak ?	Homer Simpson
oh no ! i do n't have to listen to you . if i 'm not on camera , you ca n't see me !	Homer Simpson
everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder . `` do n't leave your sprinklers on in the rain ! '' `` do n't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies ! ''	Homer Simpson
later . later .	Homer Simpson
you see , ned ... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town 's misbehavior into one small place ... creating a glittering diamond of super evil .	Homer Simpson
god created the devil ? finally , he did something cool .	Homer Simpson
well , if you ask me , you were trying to play god .	Homer Simpson
you can help me take out those cameras .	Homer Simpson
moe 's leaving town ? !	Homer Simpson
you guys should go on that cruise . you 'll have a great time , and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father ...	Marge Simpson
i like beer , hot dogs , and long blackouts on the beach .	Homer Simpson
and i can spend my mother 's day taking care of something i 've been putting off for a long time .	Marge Simpson
cleaning the gutters ?	Homer Simpson
that 's something you 've been putting off .	Marge Simpson
cartoons ! everybody be quiet !	Homer Simpson
so , marge , what were we talking about ?	Homer Simpson
why do i waste my breath ?	Marge Simpson
sorry , honey . i was n't listening . and i wo n't be listening now .	Homer Simpson
hey homer , what do you think mom meant by `` taking care of something ? ''	Bart Simpson
son , i 'm a bit of an expert on the female gender , and i can tell you : women do n't mean anything by anything .	Homer Simpson
dad ! that 's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife .	Lisa Simpson
i hear what you 're saying , lisa -- nothing .	Homer Simpson
into the playpen , sweetie . and if you get hungry , there 's lobster !	Homer Simpson
it 's from moe !	Homer Simpson
moe is running off with one of our wives ? !	Homer Simpson

homer my mother 's party 's starting any minute . get busy .	Marge Simpson
moe , my in-laws are coming . i need something strong enough that i forget i hate them , but not so strong that i tell them i love them .	Homer Simpson

now , let 's scoot together .	Lisa Simpson

where the hell are we ? i 've never seen stores like these before .	Bart Simpson
i know where we are ! this is the neighborhood where i grew up !	Marge Simpson

the march of progress .	Homer Simpson
there 's my old house !	Marge Simpson
someday when i 'm a grownup , maybe i 'll go back and look fondly at our house .	Lisa Simpson
well , stop in and say `` hi '' to me 'cause i 'll still be there -- chillin ' in my basement bachelor pad .	Bart Simpson
be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave .	Homer Simpson
as long as i can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every halloween .	Bart Simpson

just when you think i 'm out of ideas !	Bart Simpson
principal skinner ? quick question . is it true my mom was a great student ?	Lisa Simpson
well ... of course that would be great . but i see myself making an impact ... outside the home .	Lisa Simpson
maggie , something happened to mom and i 'm gon na find out what and when .	Lisa Simpson
mom 's looking good through elementary school ... ninth grade , tenth grade , still ridin ' the a-train ... then suddenly , when she was a high school senior blam !	Lisa Simpson
you kids play nice up there !	Marge Simpson
what could 've happened ?	Lisa Simpson
dad , can i talk to you for a second ?	Lisa Simpson
what is troubling you , my son ? i mean , my girl son ?	Homer Simpson
well , um , i was looking through mom 's old schoolwork , and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you .	Lisa Simpson
hey , if it had n't been me , it would have been someone or something else . sooner or later , everyone meets their `` homer . ''	Homer Simpson
no offense dad , but no boy is gon na distract me from my dreams .	Lisa Simpson
it may not be a boy . it could be anything : scrap-booking , high-stakes poker , or the santa fe lifestyle . just pick a dead end , and chill out till you die .	Homer Simpson
no ! that 's not gon na happen to me ! i 'm gon na make sure nothing distracts me ever !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm just whistlin ' , man .	Bart Simpson
but it 's not good enough , is it ?	Marge Simpson
we 're both in the same reading group . i think you know how smart i am .	Bart Simpson
i 'm not a bully ! it 's just a series of incredible coincidences !	Bart Simpson
okay , i 've gotten rid of all of my distractions , diversions , hobbies and ... oh my god !	Lisa Simpson
are you a distraction , or a higher calling ? all right , let 's see . how many jazz musicians led long and happy lives ? there 's , um ...	Lisa Simpson
that 's odd . lisa just threw her saxophone out the window .	Marge Simpson
oh , that 's probably because to her , the saxophone is a me , and she does n't want to end up like you . g'night .	Homer Simpson
she does n't want to end up like me ? !	Marge Simpson
no , she does , totally , but uh ... with a happier ending . goodnight !	Homer Simpson

how do i do that ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't know , compliment his glasses .	Marge Simpson
it 's not milhouse !	Bart Simpson
well , i am so happy to be in your class .	Lisa Simpson

uh , uh , you punch really good !	Bart Simpson
oh yeah ! and-and you always avoid the face around picture day . people appreciate that .	Bart Simpson
you really care , man . a lot of bullies just phone it in . kearney .	Bart Simpson
that school is so great ! teachers teach so much better when they 're paid in money , and not in chickens . is mom gon na come up and say goodnight ?	Lisa Simpson
your mom 's doing laundry , but she authorized me to say goodnight for her . so , by the power vested in me , i now pronounce you sweet dreams .	Homer Simpson
mom ?	Lisa Simpson
there we go . clean ... and white ... and soft .	Marge Simpson
mom ?	Lisa Simpson
i see what happened . there was no scholarship . they said i could attend if you did all their laundry . i ca n't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , honey , i insist . because it 's important to you that you do n't turn out like me .	Marge Simpson
mom ... i do n't want to go to that school .	Lisa Simpson
why not ?	Marge Simpson
because , it 's too elitist . everyone 's parents are in `` the business . ''	Lisa Simpson
what business ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't know ! they wo n't tell me ! and besides ... you were willing to do all this just so i would be happy ! mom , i 'd be honored if i turned out like you .	Lisa Simpson
mom , thanks to you , this box sucker did n't beat me up !	Bart Simpson
i 'm so glad you two are friends again .	Marge Simpson
look what maggie got !	Homer Simpson

they have a vaccine !	Marge Simpson

homer , did you know he was in the pile ?	Marge Simpson
i thought he was an old clump of rags .	Homer Simpson
this is n't the line for a movie . why are you wearing that costume ?	Marge Simpson
mr. burns ? where 's he going ?	Lisa Simpson
why did burns make us all come here ?	Homer Simpson
hell yeah !	Homer Simpson
anthill , wasp nest , moose poop , mr. burns ... mr. burns ?	Bart Simpson
my poop stick has brought him back to life ! but which end ?	Bart Simpson
what do you want ?	Bart Simpson
c'mon , man , leave me alone .	Bart Simpson
whoa ! your brains have turned to oatmeal !	Bart Simpson
this is too weird , man .	Bart Simpson
what am i gon na do with you ?	Bart Simpson
look , i know you 're cool now , but my dad hates you more than celery , and my mom said no new pets -- so i 'm hiding you in my room .	Bart Simpson
bart , who are you talking to ?	Marge Simpson
what 's all that noise ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm playing with my sergeant activity doll .	Bart Simpson
hm ... well , okay .	Marge Simpson
okay , okay . i 'll find you some food .	Bart Simpson
i hope they use that spit for a good cause , like sealing wedding envelopes .	Marge Simpson
or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer !	Homer Simpson
now they 're dancing on his grave !	Lisa Simpson
thank god mr. burns is n't alive to see this .	Marge Simpson
come back ! i 'm not finished giving you your bath !	Bart Simpson
hm , apparently mr. burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent .	Lisa Simpson
oh man , this is great . the most evil man in town is in our power . he will do my bidding ... at that fantasy football auction . and anything else my limited imagination can come up with .	Homer Simpson
just because mr. burns was mean to you , that does n't give you the right to abuse him when he 's helpless .	Marge Simpson
marge , it 's the golden rule : treat others the way they mess with you .	Homer Simpson
it 's not up to you . we 're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders . they 'll know the right thing to do .	Marge Simpson
people of springfield , to quote shakespeare , `` the quality of mercy is not strained ... ''	Lisa Simpson
you know , it takes a lot for an eight-year-old to stand up in front of the whole town .	Lisa Simpson
we 're called `` little people '' and i 'm not one .	Lisa Simpson
people of springfield , as a nerd , i understand your desire for revenge , but this sweet , harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all .	Lisa Simpson
now boy , everyone in town gets burns for half an hour to do as they will .	Homer Simpson
this town ca n't teach its kids or collect its garbage , but we lead the nation in pointless revenge .	Bart Simpson
amen .	Homer Simpson
okay , burnsie , follow the carrot !	Homer Simpson
dad , you 're gon na wreck him for everybody !	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , boy , another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end .	Homer Simpson
where 's the other girder ?	Homer Simpson
what did you do with him ?	Lisa Simpson
dad , mr. burns is here for you again .	Lisa Simpson
already ?	Homer Simpson
a little tired of revenge , are we ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah , i 've done all i can do in that medium .	Homer Simpson
all right . mr. burns , i 'm gon na show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel .	Lisa Simpson
not today .	Lisa Simpson
i thought after all you went through , you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home .	Lisa Simpson
actually , sir , the man who lived here did n't have many friends . but you 're a better person than he ever was .	Lisa Simpson
yes , technically it 's you . but like i said , people change and --	Lisa Simpson
hey , there 's a number on him . what is it ?	Lisa Simpson
mr. burns , you ca n't hurt us after all we 've done for you .	Marge Simpson
you were given six weeks to live . and you 've outlived it ! i think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people .	Marge Simpson
you 're welcome !	Homer Simpson
thank god your son ca n't see the way you 're behaving .	Lisa Simpson
and so the bloody hangman , his hair sticky with blood , skittered along the cobblestones , gunk dripping from his one good eye , singing his evil land chantey .	Homer Simpson
ker-shaw , ker-shew / i 'm after you / with my bloody noose / strong enough to hang ten moose / ker-shaw , ker-shew / it 's just a story , but it 's really true !	Homer Simpson
homer , are you scaring those kids ?	Marge Simpson
no , i 'm no-ot ! yes i am . the bloody hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of london ...	Homer Simpson
you said it was boston .	Lisa Simpson
did i ? anyway , the bloody hangman set to his gory work . bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs .	Homer Simpson
like those chairs in the music room ?	Lisa Simpson
possibly !	Homer Simpson
the hangman 's here !	Homer Simpson
ker-shaw , ker-shew , my lies have come true !	Homer Simpson
huh . it 's a pigeon .	Lisa Simpson
the poor guy hurt his wing .	Lisa Simpson
i bet it 's a combination to a safe !	Bart Simpson
or , more likely , the phone number of the bird 's owner .	Lisa Simpson
ask about the safe . no , better yet , act like you know about the safe .	Bart Simpson
yes , i believe i have your pigeon , `` raymond bird , '' and i need to know how to return him to you .	Lisa Simpson
yes , he could fly home , except that he has a broken wing . perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to springfield and retrieve him .	Lisa Simpson
looks like you 're gon na have to take care of him , bart .	Lisa Simpson
me ? just what in my long , sad history with frogs makes you think i can take care of a bird ?	Bart Simpson
no , no ... listen , do n't tell anyone , but ... i ca n't stand pigeons ! they 're like rats with wings !	Lisa Simpson
he 's crawling on your arm .	Bart Simpson
oh ... okay , maybe he 's not so bad .	Lisa Simpson
no ! no ! no ! get off ! get off ! get off !	Lisa Simpson
okay , ray , your wing is healed . go on . live your life .	Bart Simpson
aw , c'mon , man . admit it -- you knew this day would come .	Bart Simpson
you and i have shared too many seed bells to just walk away from this .	Bart Simpson
go ahead , make fun of me . i lost my heart to a bird .	Bart Simpson
man , you were not into that . what 's wrong ?	Bart Simpson
all finished , boy .	Homer Simpson
that coop looks a little flimsy .	Bart Simpson
flimsy ? this gentle pat says different .	Homer Simpson
opossum !	Marge Simpson
mom , it 's just maggie .	Lisa Simpson
now that you 're officially my bird , let me fill you in on the pecking order around here .	Bart Simpson
the top dog is me , followed by the top dog , the dog ... ... then the cat ... then you ... but do n't feel bad , you 're ahead of milhouse .	Bart Simpson
sorry man , it 's still too soon .	Bart Simpson

we 're bringing the dog because we 've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day .	Marge Simpson
you 're gon na put him down ?	Lisa Simpson
no ! for once , a pet `` going to a farm upstate '' really is going to a farm upstate .	Marge Simpson

hmm ... back yard , back yard , toilet , ocean , do n't know , back yard , flanders ' mailbox , lenny 's freezer , tire fire .	Homer Simpson

enough chitchat . time for operation dog dump .	Homer Simpson
it was n't really a lot of chitchat .	Marge Simpson
it was still too much .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sure you will , because you take such good care of your ostriches .	Homer Simpson
maybe we should get going .	Homer Simpson
bart , sweetie ... would you like to say goodbye ?	Marge Simpson
marge , i 'm watching a rerun of an important bowl game .	Homer Simpson

i mailed them the answer but they never printed it .	Homer Simpson
but it 's not my fault you 're leaving , it 's yours . because you should never , ever kill a bird . ever !	Bart Simpson
i 'd like a moment to ourselves .	Bart Simpson

for the last three years , i 've asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike . and all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that i immediately broke and threw in this bag .	Bart Simpson
but you wanted those toys .	Marge Simpson
i wanted them till i got them ! but this year i 'm gettin ' my dirt bike .	Bart Simpson
even mac davis himself could n't save this christmas .	Marge Simpson

bow , bow , bow , bow , bing , bang , boom !	Bart Simpson
so you 're the brown nosed reindeer that 's jingled all the way to the top .	Lisa Simpson
just point me to santa .	Bart Simpson
oh , i know what you 're after . the toy you never got .	Lisa Simpson
you 're outta your elfin mind !	Bart Simpson
oh really ? well let me ask you this , how many kids bring a gun to meet santa ?	Lisa Simpson
okay . you got me . but i 'm gettin ' my dirt bike -- and you ca n't stop me .	Bart Simpson
security !	Lisa Simpson
no disrespect , fat man , but you 'd better poop out a dirt bike .	Bart Simpson
listen here , kringle . i may have been naughty this year . but by today 's standards , naughty 's nothing . i did n't get anybody pregnant , i did n't facebook a kid to death ... make with my dirt bike !	Bart Simpson
oh c'mon , man . things are n't that bad .	Bart Simpson
you win .	Bart Simpson
you do n't have to do that . i have socks . i 'll give you socks !	Bart Simpson
why ca n't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs ?	Lisa Simpson
can it really be christmas when one of our parents is facing the german army ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm trying ! it just keeps popping off .	Marge Simpson
you can make it through this , marge . just think of homer .	Marge Simpson
i 'm too fat to fit in a foxhole .	Homer Simpson
kids , remember when i promised to feed us from that victory garden ? well , instead i grew this tree !	Homer Simpson
do n't dare bring that thing in here !	Lisa Simpson
you do n't want a christmas tree ? that 's crazy ! next you wo n't want a christmas ham .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry about that . i love meat and i always will .	Lisa Simpson
mmm-mm , that is some sweet pig meat . but as for christmas trees ... i used to love them -- until last year , when i went tree shopping with mom ...	Lisa Simpson
this tree reminds me of your father . it 's round in the middle , thinning on top , and your hands get sticky when you touch it .	Marge Simpson
right before christmas ?	Marge Simpson
but i ...	Marge Simpson
so i never want to see another christmas tree ... until mom comes back , safe and sound .	Lisa Simpson
sweetie , if your mother was in trouble , they 'd tell us as soon as they could .	Homer Simpson
marge is mia ? oh my god , she changed her name ?	Homer Simpson

why could n't it have been me ?	Homer Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
... ... ...	Lisa Simpson
oh no ! this is where they took mom from me !	Lisa Simpson
it 's a sign . mom 's okay ! thank you .	Lisa Simpson
whose turn is it to cry ?	Homer Simpson
yours .	Bart Simpson
look at that picture !	Homer Simpson
huh ? i thought you said you did n't want a tree .	Bart Simpson
yes , but then i learned that there 's always hope . someday this war will be over . someday our mom will be back .	Lisa Simpson
someday tv will be invented , and it will be free . then it will cost money .	Homer Simpson
but until then this tree will stand for everything mom believes in : home , family and constantly sweeping up needles .	Lisa Simpson
o tannenbaum , o tannenbaum ...	Lisa Simpson
... wie treu sind deine blã „ tter !	Bart Simpson
du grunst nicht nur zur sommerzeit , /	Lisa Simpson

wow , the killers have been kind to me ... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt ! what kind of a world is this ?	Homer Simpson
and your enemies closer ?	Homer Simpson
fit tony took his cousin 's place running the springfield mob .	Homer Simpson
the pressures got to him so he started to eat . soon , he was known as `` fit fat tony , '' then just `` fat tony '' for short .	Homer Simpson
and me ? now , i 'm just an average shnook like everyone else .	Homer Simpson
stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family . and the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby .	Homer Simpson

the moms and i had a falling out , which was a shame . we had been such good friends .	Marge Simpson
whoa . you do n't look like a mom , you look happy .	Bart Simpson

look pal , we 've got ta speed this up .	Bart Simpson
hey , does dad know you and the cool moms broke up ?	Lisa Simpson

i remember why i left this group seven years ago , and it 's why i 'm leaving now ! good day , ladies .	Marge Simpson
sorry you broke up with your friends , mom .	Lisa Simpson
i think they were never my friends ... maybe true friends are n't random people you meet at a mommy and me class . they 're random people you meet in a college dorm .	Marge Simpson
maybe lisa and i can be friends -- not with each other , but with you .	Bart Simpson

what the ? i wanted a mini-bike ! i told all my friends i was getting one !	Bart Simpson
well , if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike , then they were n't really your friends .	Homer Simpson
yes they were ! but now they wo n't be ! because i do n't have a mini-bike !	Bart Simpson
hmm , if this were a tv show that would be a helluva act break .	Homer Simpson

something wrong , bart ?	Lisa Simpson
i 've got summer squash !	Marge Simpson
hmm , the boy 's acting really weird . i did everything that tv show told me to and he 's still not happy .	Homer Simpson

very romantic . homer had the basketball game muted the whole time . oh , and then i found a gray hair . no big deal .	Marge Simpson

i ca n't take it . i 'm just going to draw a hairline on .	Lisa Simpson
so basically , my job is to make you look good by comparison . like west virginia does for virginia .	Homer Simpson
the good doctor has just the prescription .	Homer Simpson
you ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately ?	Homer Simpson
yes , that 's exactly it !	Homer Simpson

there 's a woman who 's got it all under control .	Marge Simpson
well , thank you .	Marge Simpson
you ca n't listen to those women , mom . change threatens them . they did n't like it when the springfield shopper started printing in color .	Lisa Simpson
neither did i. i did n't want to know what color the statue of liberty was . but you know what ? i was wrong . and these ladies are too .	Marge Simpson
what kind of card ?	Marge Simpson
the a.a. ? no !	Marge Simpson
a.a.a. ? no , i 'm not in triple-a . i do n't like their `` westways '' magazine . they 'll give four diamonds to any place that 's got a lid on the toilet .	Marge Simpson
p ? ! the a.a.r.p. ? ! well that tears it . i do n't want this milk and i 'm not gon na take it back .	Marge Simpson
i ... i do n't want to talk about it .	Bart Simpson
can we close the door ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't think i want to .	Bart Simpson
well ...	Bart Simpson

i thought you 'd be more supportive . i mean , you went gray yourselves .	Marge Simpson
he loves it ! he calls me his `` silver belle ! ''	Marge Simpson
why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and homer ? our marriage is rock solid !	Marge Simpson

shoo ! shoo ! shoo ! shoo ! shoo ! shoo ! shoo !	Marge Simpson
i 'm looking for homer simpson .	Marge Simpson
odd , that 's what the valet just asked me .	Marge Simpson
i do keep it together .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh . usually when it gets this quiet mr. burns is standing behind me .	Homer Simpson
get your hands off my husband !	Marge Simpson
marge ? what are you doing here ? this bar is for singles and wingmen only .	Homer Simpson
marge , marge , put down that broom . you 've got nothing to be afraid of from them . i 'm a wingman . part of a great tradition including val kilmer from `` top gun , '' wedge antilles from `` star wars , '' and me , from now . and you know why i 'm a great wingman ? because i have the confidence that comes from knowing i get to go home to you .	Homer Simpson
and you know what else this whole experience has taught me ?	Homer Simpson
true beauty is n't about hair color ?	Marge Simpson
probably .	Homer Simpson
but be honest , when i say `` beautiful woman , '' what pops into your head ?	Marge Simpson
well , i guess i do have a `` type . ''	Homer Simpson
mom , your choice to go back to blue is so empowering .	Lisa Simpson
but you said going from blue to gray was empowering .	Marge Simpson
well , as a feminist , virtually anything a woman does is empowering .	Lisa Simpson
oh .	Marge Simpson
is my job creating power , empowering ?	Homer Simpson
no . it 's oddly dehumanizing .	Lisa Simpson
hey dad , did you color your hair too ?	Bart Simpson
only my hairdresser knows for sure .	Homer Simpson
oh hello , young man ! where 's your father ?	Marge Simpson
he 's dying in a retirement home . now kiss me .	Homer Simpson

you ate his yogurt in the car .	Marge Simpson
he did n't know that !	Homer Simpson
stupid kid . all you do is cost me money . money i could be wasting !	Homer Simpson
wealthy ? hey , remember the guy who drove you to school that one time . eh ?	Homer Simpson
the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is .	Lisa Simpson

hey homer ! you want to be the voice of angry dad ?	Bart Simpson
it would be an honor !	Homer Simpson
thanks for coming out -- one announcement : the voice of angry dad will be on a speakerphone today .	Bart Simpson
there 's something going on at the nuclear plant that 's a little more important that your `` table read . ''	Homer Simpson
'angry dad : the movie . ' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs . ''	Lisa Simpson
`` family , today i graduate from my anger management class . ''	Homer Simpson
angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs .	Lisa Simpson
pained noises .	Homer Simpson
no dad , do n't say `` pained noises , '' you make pained noises .	Lisa Simpson
oh okay , uh , lenny , hit me with that chair .	Homer Simpson
hi , everyone . i 'm bart simpson , the creator of `` angry dad . '' to make this film , i had to miss countless hours of school , and there was also some hardship . i hope you like it as much as i do .	Bart Simpson
what did they think ?	Bart Simpson
do n't feel bad , boy . everyone makes mistakes . yours is just public and expensive .	Homer Simpson
you know , your movie 's not all bad . if you cut out the stuff that did n't work , it would make a great short film .	Lisa Simpson
a short film ?	Bart Simpson
many great directors , like wes anderson , frank tashlin , and tim burton started with short films .	Lisa Simpson
name one more .	Bart Simpson
taylor hackford .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know who that is , but i 'm convinced . let 's start cutting .	Bart Simpson
i am the bart .	Bart Simpson
the creative team from mixar ! pardon me . i 've seen all of your movies except `` cars , '' and i ca n't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital rembrandts of my generation !	Lisa Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
i have many people to thank ...	Homer Simpson
angry dad 's voice is part walter matthau ... hey , felix ! ... part little richard whoooo ! ... and a little bit of snoopy when he cries .	Homer Simpson
this is insane ! he did n't show up for work , he bad-mouthed the movie on jimmy fallon , and now he 's hoggin ' all the credit !	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , sweetie , this is just the first of way too many awards shows . you 'll get your chance to say ridiculous things .	Marge Simpson
my category comes up pretty soon . i 'm home free as long as this oscar show is tight and fast-paced .	Bart Simpson
i 'd like to thank mr. speedy pants repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony ... and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years ... the cute one from the bangles . see you at the cool party !	Homer Simpson
'old on -- i 'm 'earing my 'etainer .	Bart Simpson
angry dad got an oscar nomination ? !	Bart Simpson
i 'm going to the os-cars ! not as a seat fill-er ! i 'll get a gift bas-ket ! but i wo n't de-clare it !	Bart Simpson
hey ! do n't you know it 's awards season ? who 's calling you at five in the morning anyway ?	Homer Simpson
uh ... nobody . wrong number .	Bart Simpson
if i find out it 's a right number , you 're in big trouble .	Homer Simpson
my lame-o sister , lisa .	Bart Simpson
i believe it 's from lamps plus .	Lisa Simpson
homer ? well , i do n't know . l.a. 's a world-class city with a lot to offer . he 's probably enjoying the sights ...	Bart Simpson
uh-oh .	Homer Simpson
oscars ? what are you talking about ? my son gave me this list of awesome things to do in l.a .	Homer Simpson
hmm ... who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award ?	Homer Simpson
conductor , get ready to play my song !	Bart Simpson
thanks , rollin ' eighties .	Marge Simpson
i was born a rollin ' eighty , and i 'll die a rollin ' eighty .	Homer Simpson
good luck , mr. park . there 'd be no shame in losing to you .	Lisa Simpson
yes !	Bart Simpson
this is it ... i finally get to accept an award for my movie ... except it 's not just my movie . it was my sister 's idea to make this into a short . and so many animators ... every day was somebody 's birthday . and you know what ? it was my dad 's movie too . i only wish he were here and not at cerritos auto square .	Bart Simpson
you got your wish , boy . i 'm proud of ya . i 'm sorry i took all the credit .	Homer Simpson
this whole thing is silly . i mean , is n't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard ?	Bart Simpson
we can still order a replacement from the academy , right ?	Bart Simpson
hey , they 're like five bucks on ebay .	Homer Simpson
oh , hi ! ricky gervais , umm such an honor to meet you , sir ridley . i love your movies . or as i call them , `` films . '' umm , glad i bumped into you , actually . because , uh , i 'm looking to expand beyond comedy . i know what you 're thinking , sir ridley . you 're thinking `` oh my word , he 's been making me laugh all these years , but now he 's moving me as well . i 'm gon na have to put him in my new film . what do you think ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm a seat filler .	Homer Simpson
well why could n't you have said that a minute ago ? do n't take any of my ideas .	Homer Simpson
oh my god ! the legends are true !	Bart Simpson
better -- the prospectors left naughty french postcards !	Bart Simpson
whoa , mama .	Bart Simpson
`` while beautiful , the desert also harbors hidden dangers : cacti , poisonous snakes , and most deadly of all --	Lisa Simpson
scorpions ! ''	Lisa Simpson
they calm down when they 're near the springfield silvertongues !	Lisa Simpson
now they 're aggressive again ! i 'm sure there 's a correlation , but could there be a ... causation ?	Lisa Simpson
these flowers saved me from a terrible fate -- not getting an `` a '' on my next science project !	Lisa Simpson
that does n't seem fair -- they wo n't let him escape , then they kick him out . i wonder where he 'll go .	Lisa Simpson
either the grave or somewhere much worse .	Bart Simpson
okay , we 're gon na take turns having grampa as a roommate . who wants to go first ?	Marge Simpson
me ! me ! i want him every night , and forever and ever ! 'cause i love my --	Homer Simpson
fine . how 's it goin ' ?	Bart Simpson
homer , i told you he would n't sleep through it .	Marge Simpson
this calls for some springfield silvertongue !	Lisa Simpson
dad , look ! this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile !	Lisa Simpson
that 's great , honey . if you were a boy , you 'd be a scientist .	Homer Simpson
hmm , if it works on nasty scorpions , then maybe ... it 'll work on nasty stains !	Homer Simpson
it does !	Homer Simpson
and there 's something else it might be good for .	Homer Simpson
why are you guys eating so fast ?	Homer Simpson
trying to get out of here before grampa wakes up .	Bart Simpson
that 's him !	Lisa Simpson
mom , quick ! our lunches !	Bart Simpson
go ! save yourselves !	Marge Simpson
abe ? are you feeling all right ?	Marge Simpson
dad , is there anything unusual in grampa 's coffee ?	Lisa Simpson
uh , you look tense . let 's discuss this over a cup of grampa 's coffee .	Homer Simpson
to the antique store !	Bart Simpson
dad ! i know what you did !	Lisa Simpson
and i locked the back door !	Lisa Simpson
... and that 's why you 're acting so sweet and kind . because dad drugged you !	Lisa Simpson
your kisses feel like raw liver .	Homer Simpson
but it 's not real happiness . it 's just because of an untested drug !	Lisa Simpson
come on , come on , make with the laffy juice ! i wan na take grampa to have his bellybutton pierced .	Homer Simpson
it was wrong of me to play goddess !	Lisa Simpson
oh , because lisa wo n't tell me what flower it 's from .	Homer Simpson
yeah . but lisa wo n't tell me how to make it .	Homer Simpson
nerd .	Homer Simpson
huh ? this one did n't make me feel anything .	Homer Simpson
cool ! are they robots ?	Bart Simpson
thank you for the tour of your factory , mister wonka .	Homer Simpson
no , no . you 're augustus gloop , the fat german boy !	Bart Simpson
go ahead .	Homer Simpson
hm , wrong hands , eh ? that 's your cue , boys .	Bart Simpson
i 've got something you can stuff in that old bag .	Bart Simpson
i 've got some stuff to put a smile on that corpse .	Bart Simpson
do n't player hate . i 'm just a businessboy .	Bart Simpson
all right , bart . what are you up to now ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's what i was gon na call it !	Homer Simpson
oh yeah -- we better `` grump it up . ''	Homer Simpson
it 's okay , grampa -- you do n't have to act grumpy . i know you 're taking the drug , and i do n't mind -- because you 're happy .	Lisa Simpson
thanks , sweetie .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry i was so stubborn . i hope you 're not mad .	Lisa Simpson
oh , i ai n't mad , and i never will be again -- thanks to your wonderful , wonderful ...	Lisa Simpson
let me finish : thanks to your wonderful , wonderful drug .	Lisa Simpson
it happened to the scorpions too ! the flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping .	Lisa Simpson
at some point i think we should see a doctor .	Marge Simpson
no , it 's cool -- it 's like we 've got our own monster !	Bart Simpson
your grandfather is not a monster .	Homer Simpson
now , let 's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town .	Homer Simpson
at least no one else has taken this drug .	Marge Simpson
bart , why are you tugging on your collar ?	Marge Simpson
it better be tonsillitis .	Homer Simpson
well , actually ... i may have accidentally traded a few of those pills , for money ...	Bart Simpson
... which i may have already spent , ironically , on these novelty eyeglasses .	Bart Simpson
look !	Lisa Simpson
so , i guess we 're all in the same boat , huh ?	Homer Simpson
walther , when a man puts something on a frisbee , he should stand by it .	Marge Simpson
see ?	Marge Simpson
walther , let 's not be so hasty . who would begrudge them a few years of shambling , dope-fogged , into the grave ? besides , our generation 's got everything under control ! now , if you 'll excuse me , i was supposed to be drunk an hour ago . to moe 's !	Homer Simpson
flat tire ? no problem !	Homer Simpson
great idea , but i do n't have any money .	Homer Simpson
and i would n't have to pay it back for three more years ! what are the odds of that much time happening ?	Homer Simpson
problem solved . generation awesome does it again !	Homer Simpson
their `` can-do '' will bail out our `` won't-try '' every time !	Homer Simpson
so i guess the lesson here is ...	Lisa Simpson
cheech and chong are coming back to springfield ?	Homer Simpson
cheech and chong are from springfield ?	Lisa Simpson
who the hell are cheech and chong ?	Bart Simpson
bart , cheech and chong were the beavis and butthead of their day !	Homer Simpson
who are beavis and butthead ?	Bart Simpson
i 've failed as a parent . i swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy . to the media room !	Homer Simpson
he 's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily !	Homer Simpson
back then we 'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops . which was about three times .	Homer Simpson
these are comedy albums ?	Lisa Simpson
the noisy minority ... the upside-down bubblegum collective ... the regional lampoon ... the plymouth grok experiment ... fro and flo ... allan sherman 's helter shmelter ...	Lisa Simpson
what are you guys doing up there ?	Marge Simpson
hide the dope !	Homer Simpson
we do n't have any dope .	Bart Simpson

my time being wasted was not wasted !	Homer Simpson
yes ! will i get to meet dave ?	Homer Simpson
how 'bout don johnson ?	Homer Simpson
it is so cool for you to let me go on tour with cheech .	Homer Simpson
and remember , on the road , the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony . save lust and rage for me and the kids .	Marge Simpson
sweetie , do n't worry . i 'm gon na come back so horny and angry ...	Homer Simpson
awww .	Marge Simpson
i ca n't believe i 'm riding around in cheech 's van ! the van made of weed !	Homer Simpson
oh . what 's it made of ? hash ? shrooms ? lysergic acid diethylamide ?	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , cheech . i know all the classic bits of you and chong .	Homer Simpson
can we get high from the fumes ?	Homer Simpson
time to finally return your father 's overdue movies .	Marge Simpson
is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the blockbuster used to be ?	Lisa Simpson
got a better idea ?	Marge Simpson
um , hello ... i 'm marge simpson ... i think i 've given you money a of couple times ...	Marge Simpson
no , no , no , no , no , no -- i do n't want the money back , i just came for my dog .	Marge Simpson
easter grass , cable ace awards , aquariums full of broken pinball game parts , popped but uneaten jiffy pop still in the silver bubble , sample-sized shampoos , detergents and whiskeys ...	Lisa Simpson
i hate to say this about the cat lady ... but i think she 's crazy . she 's a hoarder !	Marge Simpson
this is so sad . can we help her ?	Lisa Simpson
we can . it 'll be great . like a reality show without the cameras .	Marge Simpson
you mean , just reality .	Lisa Simpson
cheech and chong has lost its chong / i am the chong now ... take a little look / take a little look / take a little look at me-e ...	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , i getcha -- `` work on the show . '' maybe we should start at four-twenty , right ? marijuana reference !	Homer Simpson
hard work ? i thought this was gon na be fun .	Homer Simpson
cheech is sure a lot less cool / than i imagined ...	Homer Simpson
better shut up / cheech is really mad / i wish that i had gone with cho-ong ...	Homer Simpson
now , we 've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours .	Marge Simpson
haul away , driver man !	Marge Simpson
wait ! wait ! wait ! wait !	Marge Simpson
a perfectly-good hot lather dispenser . i ca n't count the number of times homie 's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather .	Marge Simpson
ooh , a pen from the milwaukee hilton ! ... a phone answering machine from the '80s !	Marge Simpson

i met the new principal , mr. baumgartner . he seemed really cool . when he walked through the gym , he shot a basket !	Bart Simpson
grampa , you 're not dead .	Lisa Simpson
i never thought i 'd say this , but dad is the only one who can help us .	Lisa Simpson
it 's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from cheech and chunk .	Homer Simpson

i told you you should 've stopped the tickling .	Marge Simpson
now i have to work overtime --	Homer Simpson

-- just to counteract the self-confidence --	Homer Simpson
why did i agree to moderate this teleconference ?	Bart Simpson
you ca n't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering .	Marge Simpson
well of course , i would love to be a more sensitive father . you know that .	Homer Simpson
that 's great . then you wo n't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class .	Marge Simpson
i 'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one .	Homer Simpson

it 's `` a-b-c-1-2-3 '' ! it 's the easiest song in the world !	Homer Simpson
you think you 're better than the great simpsini ? !	Bart Simpson

homer ! homer !	Marge Simpson
what ? !	Homer Simpson
the school called and said bart is out of control . i think we may need some therapy for him .	Marge Simpson
oh , that 's ridiculous . how could two people from the same family need therapy ?	Homer Simpson
dr. zander ? kareem abdul jabbar ? anyone ?	Marge Simpson
dr. zander , what happened ?	Marge Simpson
those are pieces of broken glass .	Marge Simpson
look , now my son needs your help .	Marge Simpson
uh ... twenty-three dollars ... and there 's a can of beans in my car .	Marge Simpson
so whatever you did to my husband , it was too effective !	Marge Simpson
and now my son is a bully . can you fix him ?	Marge Simpson
then what do we win ?	Homer Simpson
okay , go straight ...	Bart Simpson
three steps right ...	Bart Simpson
two to the left .	Bart Simpson
sure do . i 'm just bad at counting . two to the right ...	Bart Simpson
backwards one ...	Bart Simpson
diagonal two ...	Bart Simpson
now do-se-do ...	Bart Simpson
while your father and brother are doing some manly bonding in the woods , i thought we could do a little bonding of our own .	Marge Simpson
we 'll do each other 's nails , make some brownie sundaes , and watch the four saddest horse movies i could find .	Marge Simpson
`` broken-leg beauty , '' `` sorry , silver , '' `` no more mint juleps ... '' and the fourth one has a title so sad i ca n't even say it .	Marge Simpson
really ? can i see it ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , i always forget about this part .	Marge Simpson
i dunno . there 's something about this noose i just do n't like .	Homer Simpson
i do n't know ...	Homer Simpson
ca n't look . texting .	Bart Simpson
i feel something for him . here it comes .	Bart Simpson
y'see ? you see how that boy pushes your buttons ?	Homer Simpson
thanks , dad .	Bart Simpson
son , you and i are gon na be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist .	Homer Simpson
pretty sweet , eh boy ?	Homer Simpson
y'know , i was skeptical , but i guess therapy works .	Bart Simpson
oh man . i ca n't believe we have to pick the peaches ourselves . this activity is so lame i 'm gon na daydream about school .	Bart Simpson
dammit , a pop quiz !	Bart Simpson
aw , come on , bart , it 's fun !	Lisa Simpson
that was kind of the same as the first time .	Lisa Simpson
why did i suggest this ?	Lisa Simpson
ooh , authentic american folk music , just like they play on n.p.r . !	Lisa Simpson
how many verses does this song have ?	Bart Simpson
not bad , not bad . marge , how much do they pay us for doing this ?	Homer Simpson
actually , we pay them for each peach we take home .	Marge Simpson
what the ? first we work , then i pay , then i have to eat fruit ? why was i ever born ?	Homer Simpson
okay , we 've got peach bruschetta on peach toast , peach-aroni peach-za , and my famous b.l.t.s -- or should i say p.p.p.s ?	Marge Simpson
c'mon , people . peaches !	Marge Simpson
honey ... on a non-stone fruit-related topic , i booked us a couples massage .	Homer Simpson
ooh , couples ! that way i can enjoy my massage , and make sure you do n't enjoy yours too much .	Marge Simpson
initiate phase two .	Lisa Simpson
i forget what phase two is , but i 'll assume we just dump the peaches like we discussed .	Bart Simpson
affirmative .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll assume that means `` yes . ''	Bart Simpson
roger .	Lisa Simpson
the name 's `` bart . ''	Bart Simpson
when we get home , the peaches will be gone .	Homer Simpson
what ? ! what ? what will we eat ?	Marge Simpson
oh screw it .	Marge Simpson
masseuses : the half-doctors , half-hookers who solve everything .	Homer Simpson
what idiot put the dump so far away from where people live ?	Bart Simpson
gentlemen , i think i have the solution to your problem .	Bart Simpson
where am i ? this neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like ... sesame street .	Lisa Simpson
wonder who 's in there . could it be oscar the ...	Lisa Simpson
help ! i 'm trapped in an alternate dimension ! an existential netherspace !	Lisa Simpson
i 've been -- hey , how ya doin ' ?	Lisa Simpson
no one sent me . i just knocked on the door and it opened !	Lisa Simpson
uh , how 'd i get from inside there to over here ?	Lisa Simpson
sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank .	Lisa Simpson
how did you do all that ?	Lisa Simpson
i do , i do !	Lisa Simpson
looks like there was magic between you two .	Lisa Simpson
would you ... be interested in teaching me ?	Lisa Simpson
what if you just taught me one trick ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm not exactly flattered by that .	Lisa Simpson
hm .	Lisa Simpson
and george washington took a trip down the ... ear-y canal !	Lisa Simpson
my ear makes money ?	Homer Simpson
hello , boat store ? i 'd like to order a boat . what do you mean , dial tone ?	Homer Simpson
from the great raymondo .	Lisa Simpson
lisa ca n't be a magician -- that 's my thing ! i 'm the one that got a magic set for christmas two years ago .	Bart Simpson
you never even opened it .	Lisa Simpson
need some help ?	Lisa Simpson
kid scissors . lame .	Bart Simpson
let 's see what else you 've been hiding in there .	Homer Simpson
i want my pot of gold !	Homer Simpson
aye ca-rum-ba .	Bart Simpson
i forgot why i 'm doing this .	Homer Simpson
raymondo ! i mastered the slide pass -- and i 've almost mastered the denver slide pass ... and , why is there always a `` denver '' version of things ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , what 's wrong ?	Lisa Simpson
ew .	Lisa Simpson
no !	Lisa Simpson
raymondo 's greatest secret !	Lisa Simpson
no , i should n't -- i wo n't .	Lisa Simpson
you are ? why ?	Lisa Simpson
students , teachers , detentionees ... prepare to have everything you believe about milk cans challenged !	Lisa Simpson
willie , if you will ?	Lisa Simpson
i believe the expression is `` ta-da ! ''	Lisa Simpson
my friends call me lisa .	Lisa Simpson
she has no friends .	Bart Simpson
shut up ! now , where were we ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , it 's a lot less dangerous than you think . you can see me do it again in a talent show next week .	Lisa Simpson
there 's no chance whatsoever . i 'll show you .	Lisa Simpson
you do n't open the top -- the locks are real .	Lisa Simpson
the can is in two halves , and they slide apart .	Lisa Simpson
from inside , you just push up . easy peasy . and there 's no way anyone can figure out how it 's done .	Lisa Simpson
raymondo , i am so sorry . i got rolled by a pro ! do you know what it 's like to be the kind of girl that boys never talk to and then suddenly a boy talks to you --	Lisa Simpson
have n't you ever been fooled by a pretty face ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , you think i 'm pretty ?	Lisa Simpson
lisa , do n't feel bad . judas betrayed jesus but he still got paid .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't stand to see one of my female children unhappy . i 'm gon na go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker !	Homer Simpson
hey , let me down ! this is gon na leave a diamond pattern on my skin !	Homer Simpson
okay , maybe secrets are a big deal , but my daughter 's a good kid . so why do n't you act your age , forgive her and let me down .	Homer Simpson
raymondo ! you forgive me !	Lisa Simpson
i 'll get him out !	Lisa Simpson
you 're just gon na stand there ?	Lisa Simpson
he 's going to die !	Lisa Simpson
i guess it 's up to me to save you , cregg demon magic freek .	Lisa Simpson
ricky jay ? david copperfield ? penn ? teller ? ! ? !	Lisa Simpson
but why ?	Lisa Simpson
wait , i know he 's an unethical magician , and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms . but he does n't deserve to die .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll save you , lisa !	Homer Simpson
the real magic is raising three kids in this economy ! you can put the ball back now .	Homer Simpson
raymondo , i knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep . raymondo ?	Lisa Simpson
and , here you go . `` do not give your coat to -- '' dammit !	Homer Simpson
so , that 's why lisa excused herself a few minutes ago .	Marge Simpson
tell me if she falls .	Bart Simpson
i was standing in this line to use the bathroom , but now my license is expired .	Homer Simpson
hey dad , there 's an arcade across the street ... and there 's really no point in all of us waiting in line ...	Bart Simpson
hmm ...	Homer Simpson
i was invited to that party !	Bart Simpson
boy that 's good .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo ! first in line ! brought you a gift bag .	Homer Simpson
all that 's left is banana runts ! that 's the worst runt !	Bart Simpson
back of the line , stranger !	Bart Simpson
we used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line , and now it 's time for our reward .	Lisa Simpson
next in line ! what am i bid for next in line ? !	Bart Simpson
sold , to the lowest bidder !	Lisa Simpson
dad , aunt selma 's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer .	Lisa Simpson
and we 've got front row seats !	Homer Simpson
my lick .	Lisa Simpson
my lick .	Bart Simpson
my lick .	Lisa Simpson
hey -- you licked the back ! that was my side !	Bart Simpson
brother germs !	Lisa Simpson
sister spit !	Bart Simpson
bart , this is a truffle .	Lisa Simpson
you 're a truffle .	Bart Simpson
a truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots . it 's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world .	Lisa Simpson
only you can make tree poop boring .	Bart Simpson
bart , you can find them by smell ! that 's amazing ! restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out .	Lisa Simpson
interested in these ?	Lisa Simpson
you 're lookin ' at him .	Bart Simpson
selma , i just ca n't get over the new you .	Marge Simpson
well , well , well , if it is n't `` before '' and `` after . '' blob and blob lite . tweedle yuck and tweedle blecch .	Homer Simpson
fat tony ! i was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend ... while insulting her hideous twin .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry , fat tony . my husband does n't realize what he 's saying , then , five seconds later :	Marge Simpson
oh my god !	Homer Simpson
you are cruel but fair .	Homer Simpson
i 'm trying . i swear i 'm trying .	Homer Simpson
dammit !	Homer Simpson
how many truffles did you get ?	Lisa Simpson
more than i can count .	Bart Simpson
brown gold ... tuscan tea ...	Lisa Simpson
just think of what we can do with that moolah .	Bart Simpson
bart , i am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest .	Lisa Simpson
that 's a lot of zeros ! you know , all this truffle hunting has made me a little thirsty . can we go home now ?	Bart Simpson
three more big ones and we 'll talk .	Lisa Simpson
how big ?	Bart Simpson
as big as a baby 's head .	Lisa Simpson
okay .	Bart Simpson
that baby 's head .	Lisa Simpson
oh , man !	Bart Simpson
yes ! i 'm so happy i lived to see this day ! he did give her the kiss of death , right ?	Homer Simpson
no !	Marge Simpson
i decorated her car for nothing .	Homer Simpson
excuse me . we ca n't find our seats . marge and homer simpson .	Marge Simpson
hm , there must be some mistake .	Marge Simpson
i 'm her sister . and you ?	Marge Simpson
we have n't even gotten our salads yet .	Lisa Simpson
why did you seat us in siberia ?	Marge Simpson
he 's on his best behavior , which is very impressive considering he 's mad about a sports result .	Marge Simpson
lousy saint louis cardinals . ca n't win the nineteen eighty-five world series on classic sports .	Homer Simpson
i was never sure about this marriage .	Marge Simpson
we 're throwing the brunch !	Marge Simpson
i still ca n't believe it . i have never been so snubbed at one of selma 's weddings .	Marge Simpson
fat tony ! are you gon na cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at christmas ? and then an old italian nun finds it . and she 's all ... no , no , no , oh , no , no ! he 's too beautiful to die ! ohhhh !	Homer Simpson
hm . so , should i bring a towel ?	Homer Simpson
um , i take a special size .	Homer Simpson
come on , bart . we 've been out here for hours .	Homer Simpson
maybe we 've found all the truffles . the only thing i 've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms .	Homer Simpson
i 'll dispose of those for you .	Homer Simpson
all i smell here is desperation .	Bart Simpson
if you think that makes me a better musher , you 're wrong . wait a second ...	Bart Simpson
this is our house . there 's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams !	Bart Simpson
the truffle 's right over here !	Bart Simpson
truffle 's in your room ? i thought you 'd been selling them !	Bart Simpson
bart ... i have n't been selling the truffles . i 've been eating them .	Bart Simpson
really ? why ?	Bart Simpson
vegetarian food is so boring ! pasta , soy ... you know what 's a bad pizza topping ? broccoli !	Bart Simpson
but i worked so hard ! i 've got dirt under my fingernails i 'll never get out . not that i 'm gon na try .	Bart Simpson
i 'm sorry , bart ! take the last truffle ... do whatever you want . sell it , eat it ...	Lisa Simpson
or give it to someone who deserves it .	Bart Simpson
you spent your life searching for these , but you never had one .	Bart Simpson
well , this is yours .	Bart Simpson
bart , you 've done a truly kind thing .	Lisa Simpson
oh , so that 's why they do n't give pigs truffles .	Lisa Simpson
i do n't think this is a good idea at all . the only husband of selma 's i liked was disco stu . he was so upbeat till he found out she did n't care for disco .	Marge Simpson
yeah , that 's his thing . anyway , fat tony and i think this is a chance to patch things up between you and selma . plus it 's a free weekend at the beach .	Homer Simpson
i will !	Marge Simpson
can you read by it ?	Marge Simpson
these people are always grinding against each other , and i think they 're all related . i wish we 'd never come .	Marge Simpson
selma ? va-va-va-wha ? !	Homer Simpson
you 've never supported mine !	Marge Simpson
well , you married someone whose first name is `` fat '' !	Marge Simpson
well , if you insist .	Homer Simpson
you are such a gentle kisser .	Homer Simpson
hey !	Homer Simpson
would n't they be girls ?	Homer Simpson
which is our room again ...	Marge Simpson
oh , my poor homie .	Marge Simpson
you know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling .	Homer Simpson
that was a mirror !	Marge Simpson
goomar ? ! that 's mob talk for `` mistress . '' fat tony has a mistress !	Marge Simpson
he 's cheating on selma ? that 's crazy ! why go out for a hamburger when you 've got rancid steak at home ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll just sit here quietly .	Homer Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson
how could tony cheat on me so soon ?	Homer Simpson
y'know selma , from what i 've seen here , fat tony has a lot of bad influences on him . i walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money .	Homer Simpson
well , homer and i are going to take you away right now .	Marge Simpson
aw , ca n't we stay one more day ? the occurrence and i are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled .	Homer Simpson
sorry , the occurrence , but to use your lingo , homer and i have to be `` that guy . ''	Marge Simpson
i do n't wan na be `` that guy , '' but marge is making me be `` that guy . ''	Homer Simpson
enough !	Marge Simpson
that 's a wife ring ? marge , do n't look !	Homer Simpson
this does n't make any sense . there was a wedding . you exchanged vows .	Marge Simpson
you were right , marge . these people are not for us .	Homer Simpson
in a good marriage , you never say i told you so .	Marge Simpson
which is lucky for me because you 're always right .	Homer Simpson
i jumped in front of your picture ! now it 's ruined !	Bart Simpson
bart , this is n't a photograph . i 'm not just gon na paint you into --	Lisa Simpson
you just ruined six months ' work !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm really sorry it was n't a year .	Bart Simpson
you 're gon na regret the day you were born !	Lisa Simpson
i already do ! it 's too close to christmas !	Bart Simpson
not to worry .	Bart Simpson
now what ?	Bart Simpson
bart , i 'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser .	Lisa Simpson
i get to enjoy this , but i 'm not responsible .	Homer Simpson
actually , dad , as the supervising parent today , you 'll get your share of the blame , too .	Homer Simpson
what do i do ? patty 's gon na kill me ! unless ... i kill her first ! i put the body in the car , i dump the car in the lake , i put a james taylor cd in the stereo so they think it 's a suicide ...	Homer Simpson
why do n't you just cut the paint out of her hair ?	Lisa Simpson
fine , whatever .	Homer Simpson
i 'll just keep cutting till i hit something solid .	Homer Simpson
and now , to break the news as gently as i know how .	Homer Simpson
wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair !	Homer Simpson
what happened to you ?	Homer Simpson
who undid my do ?	Homer Simpson
that 's just what i was going for ! i was going for scary .	Homer Simpson
you did this ? ! with your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball ? !	Homer Simpson
and stay out !	Homer Simpson
milhouse , check it out ! i put a roadblock on the curly slide !	Bart Simpson
cool ! / awesome !	Lisa Simpson
is n't this the greatest day ever ? !	Bart Simpson
there are no more great days , bart . just days .	Bart Simpson
what 's wrong , man ?	Bart Simpson
homer , thanks to your unlicensed barbery , patty and selma have been getting compliments all day at the dmv .	Marge Simpson
lady , i 'm not a hairdresser -- i just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans .	Homer Simpson
a hundred dollars ? ! marge , how much is that in smackaroos ?	Homer Simpson
one hundred .	Marge Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
well , i open a lot of crazy things when i 'm drunk , but i do n't think so .	Homer Simpson
just call me `` homer fingerhands . ''	Homer Simpson
i 'd rather call you by your normal name , if that 's okay . but i never knew you were so good with hair .	Marge Simpson
marge , when someone loses their hair , they miss it the most . it 's like a beloved dog that died on your head .	Homer Simpson
now that my soft , chestnut mane is gone , i dream of cutting hair , styling hair , making hair shorter in exchange for money ... maybe i should open a hair salon .	Homer Simpson
well ... newsweek magazine did say it 's good to change careers , right after they laid off all their editors .	Marge Simpson
yeah . but what if i ca n't find any commercial rental property ?	Homer Simpson
okay . first of all , it 's never wise to use the word `` spew '' in a love song .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry , but i do n't love you , milhouse , and i never will .	Lisa Simpson
oh now , how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago ?	Homer Simpson
homie , are you even listening to me ?	Marge Simpson
because i have so much to tell you : the mailman did the other side of the street before our side . turns out it was a substitute .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , honey . all day long i have to listen to women talk .	Homer Simpson
not a good time .	Homer Simpson
hey lis , those books are n't gon na pick themselves up .	Bart Simpson
oh . usually , milhouse does it .	Lisa Simpson
this dame is really into you !	Bart Simpson
why would a popular fifth-grader like taffy be interested in a milhouse like milhouse ?	Lisa Simpson
i dunno . it 's one of those mysteries , like how do my clothes get clean and put back in my drawers ?	Bart Simpson
well , i 'm gon na find out why , because this ...	Lisa Simpson
oh yeah . men are such dogs , and vice versa .	Homer Simpson
is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat ?	Homer Simpson
oh ? !	Homer Simpson
these are really good scissors .	Homer Simpson
all day long they tell me stupid , pointless , boring stories , and i have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face .	Homer Simpson
when i look at you -- all i see are the foibles that drive your women crazy ! foibles ! foibles ! foibles !	Homer Simpson
sorry sarah , i 'm retired .	Homer Simpson
i 'd like to see you try .	Homer Simpson
excuse me .	Homer Simpson
come on ! would you --	Homer Simpson
c'mon , bro , do n't hassle me !	Homer Simpson
stop that . okay , okay . you win . i 'll teach you how to make love to your wife !	Homer Simpson
right .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't . they wo n't let me . lenny , be a pal and saw off my hands .	Homer Simpson
suck ! of course !	Homer Simpson
oh my god . like mozart and johnny knoxville , my genius can not be stopped !	Homer Simpson
there 's only one way out -- i 'm committing barbicide !	Homer Simpson
why does n't anything kill me ?	Homer Simpson

okay . okay , the spare key is somewhere in here .	Marge Simpson
what 's this key with the plastic skull for ?	Lisa Simpson
that 's the key to my box with the real skull .	Bart Simpson
maggie !	Homer Simpson
so how come we have all these other keys ?	Lisa Simpson
well , if you live long enough you start to accumulate things . this is from a gas station men 's room . they put the block of wood on it so you do n't walk away with it . these are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was --	Homer Simpson
we got out of it just in time .	Marge Simpson
at some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners .	Marge Simpson
are you nuts ? ! let 's have some fun !	Bart Simpson
homer , stop him !	Marge Simpson
stop who , marge ? be specific .	Homer Simpson
time to get my mischief on !	Bart Simpson
let 's start with a little federal crime .	Bart Simpson
what the ? i tried to do bad and i did good !	Bart Simpson
well , it might have been the time when ...	Homer Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
or maybe i just found them on the ground .	Homer Simpson
oh my god ... there 's the fire brewer ... the beechwood ager ... the rat filter ...	Homer Simpson
the duff blimp ! oh , how i 'd love to drive that thing .	Homer Simpson
really , duff blimp ? you really want me to ?	Homer Simpson
oh , what the hell ? life is made to be lived . i 've been buttoned down too long !	Homer Simpson
when we see each other again you 'll be an old man and i 'll be a baby !	Homer Simpson
excuse me , has anyone seen my toy ?	Marge Simpson
... and these are from sardine cans your father opened . he saved them out of sentimental value .	Marge Simpson
i 'll return this to the school .	Lisa Simpson
well , maggie , one key left for us !	Marge Simpson
this looks like it 's from a wind-up toy .	Marge Simpson
i hope we have n't stumbled onto my anniversary present .	Marge Simpson
homer ? could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are ?	Marge Simpson
i 'll call you back ! come back , pooter toot ! people might be offended by your mild tastelessness !	Marge Simpson
returning this lost key to principal skinner .	Lisa Simpson
well , maybe a little . but i 'd never break the rules .	Lisa Simpson
banned books ? !	Lisa Simpson
band books ? !	Lisa Simpson
could this key open ...	Lisa Simpson
get thee behind me namuche ! that 's the buddhist satan . let 's give it a shot .	Lisa Simpson
no problem , just some cobwebs .	Lisa Simpson
i 've discovered a mystery , wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school !	Lisa Simpson
it 's like five classrooms in one ! a science room ... student lounge ... mathnasium ... an experimental theater ! all set for a production of samuel beckett 's `` endgame '' !	Lisa Simpson
ooh , a pull-down map of ...	Lisa Simpson
nothing ? and this ruler is unmarked and ... the tabs on this pop-up book have no effect ... and this tooth has no dentin ! everything is fake ! what is going on ? !	Lisa Simpson
principal skinner , do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school ?	Lisa Simpson
it 's real . i can show you !	Lisa Simpson
you 're just pressing a mento .	Lisa Simpson
hm . is it drinking and driving if you 're flying a blimp ? maybe i can find the answer by texting .	Homer Simpson
yo , lenny ... ... do you know anything about ... flying the blimp while drinking ...	Homer Simpson
what was that ?	Homer Simpson
uh-oh .	Marge Simpson
and now without further ado , i give you ... this ! ! !	Lisa Simpson
i swear there was a room here !	Lisa Simpson
maybe this key will be the key to putting the `` key '' in anarchy .	Bart Simpson
the last place anybody would expect to see a moon : the sky !	Bart Simpson
aw jeez , i hope no one heard you say that .	Bart Simpson
i 've got to get back in that room , but skinner took away the only key ! what would nancy drew do ?	Lisa Simpson
so long , suckers !	Homer Simpson
hi , my name is lisa simpson .	Lisa Simpson
that 's us . do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo ?	Lisa Simpson
how much ?	Lisa Simpson
keep the change .	Lisa Simpson
how did this bookshelf get here so fast ? i bet it 's shoddy .	Lisa Simpson
what do you think of that , nancy drew ?	Lisa Simpson
jeez , they 're dropping like flies .	Lisa Simpson
the children are on bus 23 .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so sick of keys . they 've brought nothing but good luck since i got them .	Bart Simpson
that wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere .	Marge Simpson
chief wiggum ! stop that train !	Marge Simpson
skinner 's involved in this . deep .	Lisa Simpson
crazy classroom , bus full of missing kids ... i know who 'd have some answers . someone who 's been here a long , long time .	Bart Simpson
you know anything about ... bus twenty-three ?	Lisa Simpson
there 's only one bed that 's just right for me , the bed with the truth in it . which is probably the third one .	Lisa Simpson
so the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge .	Lisa Simpson
but it 's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing .	Bart Simpson
hey , kids !	Homer Simpson
if i tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up ? do n't drink it !	Homer Simpson
that 's where the ice bridge would be ! go down !	Lisa Simpson
dad , stop !	Lisa Simpson
but there 's so many buttons !	Homer Simpson
bart , take the controls !	Homer Simpson

that 's not a real arm -- it 's plastic !	Lisa Simpson
that does n't mean you 're any better than him , young lady . he could be a war hero .	Homer Simpson
no , i mean they 're mannequins !	Lisa Simpson
there 's nothing i can do to save my sister , the blimp or this airship .	Bart Simpson
all pooted out .	Homer Simpson
oh , i 'm sorry , homie .	Marge Simpson
it 's worse than you think . i have to buy you a new anniversary present .	Homer Simpson
skinner and chalmers loaded that bus with those kids ... but why ?	Lisa Simpson
otto ? are you the one who left the message on the blackboard ?	Lisa Simpson
otto , they 're just mannequins !	Lisa Simpson
looking for something ?	Bart Simpson
does it look like ... this ?	Bart Simpson
well , there 's one thing you did n't count on : my dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm sorry , but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party . luckily , as equipment manager , i ... was not ... invited ! woo-hoo !	Lisa Simpson

no one cancels my free play !	Bart Simpson
sorry , man .	Bart Simpson

i thought i was .	Homer Simpson
psst ! mrs. k !	Bart Simpson
down here !	Bart Simpson
you should n't suffer for my bad deed . it should just go unpunished forever .	Bart Simpson

aye carumba !	Bart Simpson
mrs. k. , i 'm here to spring you .	Bart Simpson
you did n't do that .	Bart Simpson
who says you 're leaving ?	Bart Simpson
mm , i use it to workshop my pranks .	Bart Simpson

i ca n't believe a middle-aged woman is scared of a three-story drop .	Bart Simpson
awww ...	Homer Simpson
little help ... little help ... flanders , little help ?	Homer Simpson
see ya tomorrow , teach .	Bart Simpson
mrs. k. ? are you still bumping moustaches with ned ?	Bart Simpson
even on snow days ?	Bart Simpson
but ... what if my dog eats it ?	Bart Simpson
yeah ... um ... he hates how learning has taken me to a place he 'll never go . see ?	Bart Simpson
hang on . wait a minute .	Bart Simpson
oh , absolutely , ned . sorry .	Homer Simpson
little help ...	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , sweetie . daddy will put jack back in the box .	Homer Simpson
okay , time to go back in the ... night-night ... this is harder than it looks ... do n't you humiliate me in front of my kid ... i thought we had a deal , man !	Homer Simpson
well , if it is n't the local school marm ... and his new girlfriend . that 's a burn on you , flanders .	Homer Simpson
whoa ! flanders , this chick does not get our thing !	Homer Simpson
yeah , language .	Homer Simpson
marge , tell her how i do n't push ned around .	Homer Simpson
actually , sometimes you do push ned around .	Marge Simpson
do n't do that , homie . it rubs off your side hair .	Marge Simpson
hey ned , can i borrow some hair ?	Homer Simpson
see , dad ? having krabappel next door is nothing but trouble . teachers should not be allowed to live near their students . we 're natural enemies , like george washington and abraham lincoln .	Bart Simpson
do n't panic , son . we can bust up teachy and preachy . here 's what we do : i 'll take flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life . you scare rod and todd by telling them krabappel will become their evil stepmother .	Homer Simpson
if fairy tales have taught us one thing , it 's that first wives are perfect , second wives are horrible .	Bart Simpson
just the opposite of real life .	Homer Simpson
yeah , is n't this place great ? if you 're single you can come here every night .	Homer Simpson
ned , let 's cut to the chase .	Homer Simpson
ned , if it 's boneheaded to talk you outta seein ' edna , then i do n't wan na be brainheaded .	Homer Simpson
oh ned , i never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude .	Homer Simpson
oh , you beautiful , beautiful wuss .	Homer Simpson
and cinderella 's stepmom made her sew clothes and mop the floor .	Bart Simpson
no , i ...	Bart Simpson
ned , i have a confession to make : i may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk . but now , from the bottom of my heart , i wish you and edna the best .	Homer Simpson
fellow barflies ! to ned flanders and edna krabappel !	Homer Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
guys , quit telling the truth !	Homer Simpson
um ... uh ... so uh , joey , is wikipedia accurate when it says `` walk this way '' was inspired by `` young frankenstein ? ''	Homer Simpson
do n't you mean `` neighboreeno ? ''	Homer Simpson
you stupid jerks ! i ca n't believe you could be so cruel ! especially you , joey kramer !	Homer Simpson
i hope you 're proud of yourself , homer .	Marge Simpson
i 've got some bad news for you , marge . i 'm actually not .	Homer Simpson
well , there 's ned out on his power walk . maybe you should talk to him .	Marge Simpson
wha ? my doctor said `` do n't walk . ''	Homer Simpson
that was a traffic signal .	Marge Simpson
he 's a good man and a good neighbor and you 're drinking coffee from his mug right now .	Marge Simpson
flanders , hold up !	Homer Simpson
i know , i know you 're not comfortable with all the guys edna 's seen around town .	Homer Simpson
ned , i 've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving ! endless , endless forgiving !	Homer Simpson
and did n't the easter bunny himself say `` forgive them , father , for finding all my eggs ? '' and if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs , maybe you and edna can find a way to make it work .	Homer Simpson
so we 're going to let the internet decide . should ned and edna stay together ? visit thesimpsons.com and vote .	Marge Simpson
we 'll announce the results in next year 's season premiere . probably at the end so you 'll watch the whole thing .	Marge Simpson
there 's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits , frenemies with frenefits , super friends with wonder pets , all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name .	Homer Simpson
homer ! stop teasing !	Marge Simpson
right . teasing .	Homer Simpson
i 'm waitin ' for ya .	Homer Simpson
also , if you wan na find the real shooter of mr. burns , go back and look for more clues . they 're all there !	Homer Simpson
homie , it was maggie .	Marge Simpson
yeah , right . a baby shot a guy .	Homer Simpson
just vote ! it 's your duty as a citizen of tv .	Marge Simpson

the warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence .	Homer Simpson

sheez !	Homer Simpson
maybe i was a little hard on him , expecting him to be larry right away . by the way , where is larry ?	Homer Simpson
good ol ' larry .	Homer Simpson
say ... wayne , i could n't help but notice that your breath does n't smell like alcohol . you want to go grab a beer after work ?	Homer Simpson

you tricked us !	Bart Simpson
i like routine . i like routine .	Lisa Simpson
did you have a hard day too ?	Marge Simpson
no , a guy at work seems not to like me . i guess it 's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay .	Homer Simpson
it 's big to you . would you like a `` get well '' pork chop ?	Marge Simpson
i love you so much ! potatoes and gravy on the side , please .	Homer Simpson
charlie , wan na grab a beer ?	Homer Simpson
oh . okay .	Homer Simpson

wayne , maybe it 's the me being still alive talking , but i think you 're awesome .	Homer Simpson
well , if anyone saves my homie 's life , they get a free meal . which actually comes up about once a week .	Marge Simpson
so wayne , how 'd you learn all those cool self-defense moves ?	Bart Simpson
oh c'mon , stay for dessert !	Homer Simpson

it 's best to concentrate on what you do have .	Homer Simpson
wayne , stop ! that 's mr. burns .	Homer Simpson
why do n't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet ?	Homer Simpson
of course . i mean , how long could it be ?	Homer Simpson
that 's funny , because i have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future .	Homer Simpson
that robot took our jobs !	Homer Simpson
he said it .	Homer Simpson
or maybe it was him .	Homer Simpson
man , this robot really gets me .	Homer Simpson
your voice is so gravelly , just like lauren bacall 's .	Homer Simpson
well , what brought you to springfield ? was it our frito lay distribution center ?	Marge Simpson
neh , they could n't find a google map photo without me naked or urinating .	Homer Simpson
and when there was a map-maker 's convention here , they all got lou gehrig 's disease .	Marge Simpson
not the one you 're thinking of , there 's another one .	Homer Simpson
i admit it ! i let milhouse lie down in your bed !	Bart Simpson
kids , can i talk to wayne alone a minute ?	Marge Simpson
remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code .	Bart Simpson
what do you mean `` no ? ''	Bart Simpson
i do n't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques .	Marge Simpson
apology accepted . now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks ?	Marge Simpson
we 'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets !	Marge Simpson

aww , that 's what i call closure !	Homer Simpson
wait ! i know a place you can go ! a place where a sadistic man with government experience can feel right at home .	Marge Simpson
they always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we do n't need for kids we did n't want .	Homer Simpson
wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed , the basketball nets are fishing nets ...	Marge Simpson
i do n't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school .	Homer Simpson

wow . and here i thought god created all this . thanks for setting me straight .	Bart Simpson
you 've filled my head with horse poop and atheism ! and all these years i thought i was unteachable .	Bart Simpson
a man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards .	Bart Simpson
just quoting our twenty-sixth president , lis . you could use a little t.r . in your life .	Bart Simpson
please ! i went through my t.r . phase in first grade . now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin .	Lisa Simpson

dad , i 'm going to entertain you with the help of `` the brothers karamazov . '' `` alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov ... a landowner well known in our district in his own day , and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death , which happened thirteen years ago , and which i shall describe in its proper place . ''	Lisa Simpson
oh my god ! she 's still on the first sentence ! must make her stop ... how to express my ...	Homer Simpson

aw , come on , dad , be a foodie ! you 're already a fatty and a drunkie !	Bart Simpson
i do n't want to think about food , i want to like it . why drive across town to `` savor '' a bowl of mystery mush when there 's four different krustyburgers we can see from our house ?	Homer Simpson
oh , and here 's my favorite restaurant : `` la fridge ! '' it 's open twenty-four hours a day and there 's no dress code !	Homer Simpson
what kind of american man does n't want to explore global food culture ?	Lisa Simpson

it 's called `` el chemistri '' and they use science to make the food !	Lisa Simpson
pine needle ... sorbet ... pine needle sorbet ! ! my kids do not eat sorbet , they eat sherbet , and they pronounce it `` sherbert '' and they wish it was ice cream !	Homer Simpson
sorry , dad -- this is our thing now .	Bart Simpson
fine . blow off `` fun dad , '' go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs .	Homer Simpson
do n't be so jealous , homie , just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me .	Marge Simpson

kids , i was thinking ... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner ?	Marge Simpson
relax -- dad will be the life of the party . he 'll be the fourth mouth-keteer .	Bart Simpson
but there were n't four musketeers ...	Marge Simpson
yeah-huh : athos , porthos , aramis and d'artagnan .	Lisa Simpson
d'artagnan was n't a musketeer ! he only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost !	Marge Simpson
you know , i 'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner . maybe i 'll like it .	Homer Simpson
oh , i doubt it . you sit at communal tables , full of hipsters .	Marge Simpson
well , actually , i 've come around on hipsters . takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat .	Homer Simpson
and the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals , or served in a test tube . it 's too crazy for you .	Marge Simpson
so it 's weird -- do n't worry , i 'll make it fun .	Homer Simpson
yeah , you always do . well , here 's where to meet us ...	Marge Simpson
1501 w -- east oak street .	Marge Simpson

is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking ?	Homer Simpson
the experience begins !	Homer Simpson
where 's dad ?	Bart Simpson
um ... i do n't know . probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts .	Marge Simpson
just like marge said -- chemicals and test tubes . the open kitchen is a nice touch .	Homer Simpson
i guess i 'll get started before my family gets here . how much for a taste , you know , just to get me going ?	Homer Simpson
ouch , this place is fancy .	Homer Simpson
hipsters ... too cool for school ...	Homer Simpson
well , my wife thinks it 's too crazy for me , but i 'm gon na prove her wrong .	Homer Simpson
i 'm doing this for my family !	Homer Simpson
this better be dinner theater !	Homer Simpson
a hundred pork chops !	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe dad is missing this !	Lisa Simpson
sure , your dad 's great , but i 'm fun too -- look at me eat , huh ! d'oh ! d'oh ! d'oh !	Marge Simpson
who am i kidding ? i 'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing . i 'm calling homer .	Marge Simpson
marge ! this is n't a food restaurant ! it 's a meth restaurant ! a meth-taurant !	Homer Simpson
foodies , help me ! my husband 's in danger !	Marge Simpson
a wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong !	Marge Simpson

it 's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs !	Marge Simpson
ex-tinct !	Homer Simpson
we 're not here for you , we 're here for lenny .	Homer Simpson
ooo kids , did you hear that lesson ?	Marge Simpson
how is that the lesson ? the point of the dinosaurs is : no matter what we do an asteroid 's gon na wipe us out . so we should party hard and wreck the place .	Bart Simpson
yeah , why should the asteroid have all the fun ?	Homer Simpson
what ? they 've got a point .	Marge Simpson
gift shop !	Lisa Simpson
all right , you can each have one toy .	Homer Simpson
lisa has a big toy ! no fair ! that means i get two small toys !	Bart Simpson
no fair ! this is n't big , it 's medium !	Lisa Simpson
no fair , then i get four small toys and lisa gets one medium and one small .	Bart Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
he gets four and i only get two ? ! no fair !	Lisa Simpson
all right , that 's it ! forget it ! no toys for anyone !	Homer Simpson
okay -- maggie gets a toy !	Homer Simpson
no fair !	Lisa Simpson
choke on fossil poop !	Bart Simpson
hey -- i know you ...	Lisa Simpson
wait ! wait ! come back ! dad ! follow that dinosaur !	Lisa Simpson
i 've waited my whole life to hear that !	Homer Simpson
so tired ... go on without me .	Homer Simpson
you 're t.r . francis ! you wrote the angelica button books ! they 're my favorite fantasy novels !	Lisa Simpson
but why are you working at a dinosaur show ? and why did you run away from me ? and how did angelica get a new wand after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest ? and --	Lisa Simpson
of course you 're real ! everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus . how could that be made up ? !	Lisa Simpson
everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie !	Lisa Simpson
it 's not against the law to sleep in a tyrannosaurus head !	Homer Simpson
i demand to speak to my paleontologist !	Homer Simpson
can i have my allowance early ? i need to buy some carbon-offset credits so i can burn all my angelica button books .	Lisa Simpson
oh honey , i 'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur . but you liked the stories when you read them , so what does it matter ?	Marge Simpson
does n't it bother you that betty crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men ?	Lisa Simpson
i know you 're hurting , but that 's no reason to lash out at me .	Marge Simpson
can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks ?	Lisa Simpson
a million bucks ?	Homer Simpson
every book on the `` young adult '' charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids !	Lisa Simpson
i know five idiots !	Homer Simpson
and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time ! it 's the perfect crime -- as long as you do n't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds .	Lisa Simpson
the perfect crime , eh ?	Homer Simpson
whatever the job is , i 'm not interested .	Bart Simpson
a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours .	Homer Simpson
i like the beat -- play me the tune .	Bart Simpson
we 're taking down kids who read .	Homer Simpson
chapter-book crowd ? that 's a juicy peach , but what 's the cream ?	Bart Simpson
i 'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write .	Homer Simpson
tween-lit gang-write ?	Bart Simpson
tween-lit gang-write . but this babar needs a zephyr .	Homer Simpson
a zephyr ?	Bart Simpson
you 're the zephyr .	Homer Simpson
this better not turn out like kansas city .	Bart Simpson
it wo n't be like kansas city .	Homer Simpson
come on , skinner , you 're the best kid-man in the business . you 've read their notes , searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think .	Bart Simpson
with your share of the money , you could get your own studio apartment ...	Bart Simpson
come on beautiful , i ca n't do the job without you , so what do you say ?	Homer Simpson
our crew needs you , bouvier . you 've read enough fantasy novels to choke a hippogriff !	Bart Simpson
the caper is writing a kids ' fantasy novel .	Homer Simpson
all we need now is a computer guy ...	Bart Simpson
do you have a computer ?	Homer Simpson
you 're in .	Homer Simpson
i keep going over the job from every angle , but i ca n't shake the feeling that we 're missing something .	Bart Simpson
relax , with the team we put together , our book 'll fly off the shelves , and we 'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in shelbyville .	Homer Simpson
you 're group-writing a book ? ! but the only reason anyone would ever do that is ... profit !	Lisa Simpson
like no one ever writes for money , lisa . i do n't see your boyfriend william shakespeare missing too many meals .	Bart Simpson
i 'll show you ! i 'll write a book myself ! a personal story my readers will connect with !	Lisa Simpson
wait , you 're gon na be all the guys ? how would that work ?	Homer Simpson
this is how real writers do it . i 'll just bang out two thousand words and then i 'll stop , even if i 'm on fire . i got ta pace myself . `` chapter one . '' wait , i ca n't start without music to inspire me .	Lisa Simpson
why is bach next to muddy waters ? that 's my problem -- i got ta get these cds organized !	Lisa Simpson
there , finished . now if i win just two more games of online boggle , i 'll be ready to start writing .	Lisa Simpson
spot , stop , sop , top-tops , pot-pots , opt-opts , post !	Lisa Simpson
okay , we 've cased a lot of tween books -- what 's their m.o . ?	Bart Simpson
okay , our book will be about ... an orphan who goes to a magical school ... where he discovers he 's ... a vampire !	Homer Simpson
no one 's goin ' anywhere . okay , the vampire genre is sucked out . all we got ta do is find a new monster to be our hero .	Bart Simpson
a troll , that 's it ! our book could be about an orphan troll !	Bart Simpson
the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team ?	Homer Simpson
okay , gaiman , you 're in . your job is to get lunch . and lose the british accent .	Bart Simpson
but why ?	Homer Simpson
sitting in a coffee shop -- i could n't feel more like a real writer ! oh , better set up my wi-fi in case i need to do some research ! but if i 'm gon na use their free internet , i really should buy something .	Lisa Simpson
god , i love being a writer !	Lisa Simpson
it 's good . `` weekly reader star selection '' good .	Bart Simpson
i just hope we put in enough steampunk , whatever that is .	Homer Simpson
the troll twins of underbridge academy .	Homer Simpson
oh , you did n't write any of it !	Bart Simpson
i 've got it ! a mermaid falls in love with a boy on land ... i 'm a genius !	Lisa Simpson
writing is the hardest thing ever !	Lisa Simpson
hope you do n't mind us printing our book in your room , lis .	Bart Simpson
yeah , only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript .	Homer Simpson
correction : finished manuscript .	Bart Simpson
woo-hoo !	Homer Simpson
we know , we wrote it .	Homer Simpson
fake author ?	Bart Simpson
stupid , stupid , stupid ! we forgot to create a fake author !	Homer Simpson
okay , stay frosty ! all we need to do is find some sap to pretend to be the writer of our book . so hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna-be author !	Bart Simpson
coming to the book fair was a great idea ... 'cause you ca n't write if you do n't know what the competition 's up to !	Lisa Simpson
a dog wrote a bestseller ? ! aargh ! all i 've done is procrastinate ! who am i kidding ? there will never be a book with my name on it .	Lisa Simpson
or ... your name could be on a book in ten minutes .	Homer Simpson
do i have to do any writing ?	Lisa Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
i 'm in .	Lisa Simpson
i was raised in a traveling circus . my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber . i wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box . it was featured in the new yorker 's `` best forty under four '' issue .	Lisa Simpson
gentlemen ! to `` the troll twins of underbridge academy ! ''	Homer Simpson
so , does this square us for kansas city ?	Homer Simpson
square as `` golden books , '' pop .	Bart Simpson
what happened to me ? in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most -- a literary fraud .	Lisa Simpson
but lis , when this book comes out , you 'll be beloved ! not just by milhouses , you 'll get attention from jacksons , xanders -- even aidens !	Bart Simpson
aww , i 've always wanted an aiden ...	Lisa Simpson
how could the publishers change our book ? if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel , the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope 's private naked dude mural !	Homer Simpson
but the trolls were the best part ! do the characters still say `` troll-y '' instead of `` cool ? ''	Homer Simpson
oh , that is so untroll-y !	Homer Simpson
british fonzie is right . our story is actually more important ... than money .	Homer Simpson
rule number one of book heists : `` never fall in love with the book . '' we queer the deal -- we lose the money !	Bart Simpson
yeah ?	Bart Simpson
let 's steal back our book .	Bart Simpson
somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece .	Homer Simpson
the book prints at midnight . so if we swap in the original version , they 'll print the wrong book -- our book .	Bart Simpson

dad , these are your great-grandsons .	Homer Simpson
see you next christmas !	Homer Simpson
to prove a point . everyone thinks their dad 's a jerk and everyone 's right . but when you get older , you realize how much you love 'em .	Homer Simpson
your dad may be a little immature , but i know he loves you , so you ought to give him a chance .	Homer Simpson

maybe because deep down , you know you do n't believe in what you 're doing .	Lisa Simpson
oh my god , she 's right . my lips will say anything , but my eyes know the truth . my ears are keeping their mouth shut .	Homer Simpson
my fellow americans ... i am full of crap .	Homer Simpson

less blathering , more slathering .	Homer Simpson
hop on !	Bart Simpson
hm , i kinda want to create my own thing . do you sell any just plain sets ?	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'll just buy one of these and build something different .	Lisa Simpson

let me just download the complete works of shakespeare .	Homer Simpson
now who 's the greatest writer of all time ?	Homer Simpson
i 'd have more friends if i knew what people liked . but i wo n't know what people like unless i 'm their friend . it 's a conundrum .	Lisa Simpson
helpful hint : if you want friends , do n't use words like `` conundrum . ''	Bart Simpson
jimbo heard me say it . i 'm dead .	Bart Simpson
hm ...	Lisa Simpson
it 's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person . what if i started an online meeting place where all are equal and i am the undisputed center ?	Lisa Simpson
no , that is not true ! i --	Lisa Simpson
all right already ! i had no friends .	Lisa Simpson
so , since i had no friends , i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network . did we become friends ? no .	Lisa Simpson
as the ceo of springface , i want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles .	Lisa Simpson

i still wan na see it .	Homer Simpson
then why did you say it ?	Homer Simpson
are you just saying that 'cause you do n't want me to see the hippo ?	Homer Simpson
man , this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer .	Homer Simpson
i am sitting here ... zero sheets to the wind ...	Homer Simpson
... counting the moments to closing time when i can stumble home to you . another round , moe . uh-oh . did i type that ? delete ! delete ! hm , typing `` delete '' does not delete .	Homer Simpson
friend , friend , awaiting reply , friend ...	Lisa Simpson

i have a thousand friends , and i feel more alone than ever !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm trying to set a mood here .	Lisa Simpson
as i was saying , springface was used in ways i never expected .	Lisa Simpson
check this out . i 'm hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses , so when kearney loots their ammo , he gets a face full of ass shrapnel .	Bart Simpson

i 'm gon na run his plates , find out who he is , then change his springface profile picture to a shot of a monkey . get that , marge ? a monkey !	Homer Simpson
homer ! watch the road !	Marge Simpson

we do n't need your website . we can make anything into guns .	Bart Simpson
you really want me ?	Lisa Simpson
marco !	Homer Simpson
come on , lisa !	Homer Simpson
polo !	Lisa Simpson
fish out of water !	Homer Simpson
... and that 's why i really do n't believe there 's a god . thank you , and god bless america .	Homer Simpson
well i 'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere .	Homer Simpson
that 's even sadder than being friends with milhouse !	Bart Simpson
tired of what ? i dump on you , and you take it -- that 's how friendship works .	Bart Simpson
what gives ? he 's not crawlin ' back .	Bart Simpson
even a kid who wears a `` finding nemo '' back brace has some pride . you went too far this time , bart .	Lisa Simpson
witty .	Homer Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
listen , um ... after our fight , i could n't sleep .	Bart Simpson
c'mon , man . at least listen to what i have to say .	Bart Simpson
um ... well ... this is usually the part where you say you 're sorry .	Bart Simpson
i know , i made you into a real boy last week .	Bart Simpson
needs flavor .	Homer Simpson
wait . what ? no !	Bart Simpson
milhouse ! what do i have to do , besides changing in any way , to get you to forgive me ?	Bart Simpson
really ? it 's not that bad , is it ?	Bart Simpson
milhouse , you 're the closest thing i have to a brother . a brother with the wisdom of an older sister . and that 's why we squabble , 'cause families always do . but in the end , they 're still a family . what do you say ... brother ?	Bart Simpson
yes i did . now i 'm going to bed .	Lisa Simpson
but-but-but ...	Bart Simpson
what 's for dinner , ma ?	Bart Simpson
rag soup !	Marge Simpson
that 's better .	Homer Simpson
oxygen ... i need oxygen .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , man . a few more balloons and this 'll look really awesome .	Bart Simpson
milhouse .	Bart Simpson
i 've been out here all night , man . just let me know what it 'll take for you to forgive me .	Bart Simpson
sure .	Bart Simpson
sure , what 've you got ? puppy goo-goo comin ' my way ?	Bart Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
from now on i 'll dominate you ... in ways you do n't realize .	Bart Simpson
come on in !	Marge Simpson
well , during the town meeting , which now seems like years ago , i forgot my purse at your bar ... and when i came back to get it , i saw how much you love that rag .	Marge Simpson
it seemed a little ... `` ripe '' , so i brought it home to clean it for you .	Marge Simpson
well , that 's not true ! everyone in this family is your friend .	Marge Simpson
your bar is the closest thing this town has to an algonquin roundtable .	Lisa Simpson
yeah , yeah , okay , second closest .	Lisa Simpson
that 's a bill .	Bart Simpson
maybe we should just watch tv .	Bart Simpson
oh marge , this is brilliant .	Homer Simpson
it 's a beautiful afternoon . no tv .	Marge Simpson
luckily , she does n't know that our viewing platforms are ... multi .	Bart Simpson
no tv on the computer !	Marge Simpson
no tv on a smart phone !	Marge Simpson
that might be a good idea , but then again , you thought it up . eh , why not ?	Bart Simpson
why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on valentine 's day ?	Bart Simpson
we show girls love on valentine 's day , and they let us blow stuff up on the fourth of july . i just pray they never fall on the same day .	Homer Simpson
homie , read this .	Marge Simpson
`` my darling husband . this valentine 's day , i have a present for you ... ''	Marge Simpson
thanks for reading it to me .	Homer Simpson
my pleasure .	Marge Simpson
... i want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff . do n't worry about me , i 'll be fine .	Marge Simpson
i just think we should do things every day to show our love for each other .	Marge Simpson
it 's okay , homie . go . have a good time . take bart with you !	Marge Simpson
which one do you want ?	Homer Simpson
you have the most wonderful mom in the world , which is why i have no idea where she is or what she 's doing .	Homer Simpson
that 's right , sucker ! it 's valentine 's day , and i 've got a date with some fastballs !	Homer Simpson
lisa , i love spending mother-daughter time with you . we have so much in common , like ... um ... oh no ! someone 's about to put the thousand island ladle into the vinaigrette !	Marge Simpson
sorry , sorry , i did n't mean to be nosey .	Lisa Simpson
you have a way with words .	Lisa Simpson
mom , i 'm gon na look at the desserts !	Lisa Simpson
do n't panic . this can be separated out . quick ! does anyone have a centrifuge ? !	Marge Simpson
yep , you 're the crack head . what dessert are you gon na get ?	Lisa Simpson
um , i should probably get back to my mom . by the way , my name is --	Lisa Simpson
lisa . now this is the most important place in the world .	Lisa Simpson
lisa ?	Marge Simpson
today we tackle the most terrifying `` myth '' in the history of springfield elementary : that if you press e-8 on the candy machine , you get electrocuted and die .	Bart Simpson
something like that .	Bart Simpson
ladies and gentlemen , that myth is ... cracked !	Bart Simpson
this place is great ! if i cover my peripheral vision , i feel like i 'm in france !	Lisa Simpson
ew . how 'bout i 'll just look at you .	Lisa Simpson
it 's ... nice .	Lisa Simpson
mom , i 'm sorry i 'm late ! no excuse , i just forgot all about you . huh ? i 'm not sure that patch really represents who i am right now .	Lisa Simpson
well . i usually take lisa , but i can just go with bart .	Marge Simpson
well , if you 'd been here for the design phase , you could 've registered that objection . now start quilting !	Marge Simpson
now there 's three of you ?	Marge Simpson
according to the wisdom of our elders ... if you go all the way around on the swing , your body will turn inside-out .	Bart Simpson
he 's still inside-in , folks ! and just to prove it :	Bart Simpson
`` she had now come to the part that peter pan hated . ' i do like a mother 's love , ' said tootles ... ''	Marge Simpson
mom , i have a crush !	Lisa Simpson
is it on your father ? little girls always get crushes on their fathers .	Marge Simpson
somehow i missed that phase .	Lisa Simpson
almost there , boy . almost there . almost there .	Homer Simpson
i 'm getting ' closer . it 's just within reach .	Homer Simpson
the boy i like is hemingway-esque !	Lisa Simpson
okay . let 's `` esque '' him to dinner .	Marge Simpson
wow , nick here in our house . i hope it does n't make him think less of me .	Lisa Simpson
this house is not an embarrassment !	Marge Simpson
usually when i say something like that , something extremely embarrassing happens . i 'm gon na say goodnight before it does .	Marge Simpson
oh , my . i do n't know if anyone 's ever kissed my hand before .	Marge Simpson
well , your arms are lanky . it 's kind of a long trip down there .	Homer Simpson
hm , the french have gotten into the wine game . good luck catchin ' up with the big boys .	Homer Simpson
i 'll get a couple glasses .	Marge Simpson
you 're going with me ! but lisa , after this , i do n't want you to spend any more time with this boy . if you do , it 'll mean you 're a separate person from me .	Marge Simpson
mom ca n't appreciate the kind of boy nick is , because although i love dad , he 's a completely different creature .	Lisa Simpson
nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths !	Lisa Simpson
man , that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story , they own it .	Lisa Simpson
grampa , would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission ?	Lisa Simpson
legend has it a girl named eleanor mackie drowned on this very spot . now they say if you call her name three times while looking in this mirror , you will die . milhouse ?	Bart Simpson
okay . that was the last school myth and it 's officially ... cracked .	Bart Simpson
you into cigars now ?	Bart Simpson
i ca n't be the guy who killed everybody 's fun . that 's skinner 's job .	Bart Simpson
milhouse , i 've just figured out a way to make school cool again .	Bart Simpson
i have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of groundskeeper were-willie .	Bart Simpson
prepare to be disappointed !	Bart Simpson
gentlemen , we just created a myth .	Bart Simpson
mulberry island . we 'll kiss there at sunset .	Lisa Simpson
ow !	Lisa Simpson
if we stop now , we 'll never make it there by sunset .	Lisa Simpson
but grampa ...	Lisa Simpson
we could take this boat .	Lisa Simpson
i thought you rowed up the zambezi without a guide .	Lisa Simpson
so , dad , what kind of stupid idea did you put in lisa 's head ?	Homer Simpson
did you say `` ultimate frisbee ? ''	Homer Simpson
women and shoes , am i right ?	Homer Simpson
you know , you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table .	Lisa Simpson
shut up and kiss me .	Lisa Simpson
wait , how long is this love for again ?	Lisa Simpson
hm , that 's a pretty long time .	Lisa Simpson
lisa !	Marge Simpson
i feel kinda silly i walked all the way out here . you 're just fine . you always are .	Marge Simpson
thanks . but i could n't have done it , mom . i mean , the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you 'll love for the rest of your life .	Lisa Simpson
do n't worry , ladies ! i'm-a comin ' !	Homer Simpson
you know , i heard if a fat guy stops moving , he floats .	Homer Simpson
sorry , dad . i was afraid the dragon would n't cough the moon back up .	Homer Simpson
i know it 's futile , but i must again point out there is no dragon .	Lisa Simpson
then why am i paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance ?	Homer Simpson
again , i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , everyone knows dragons do not attack cars . jeez , pick up a book .	Homer Simpson
i pick up books like you pick up beers !	Lisa Simpson
then you have a serious reading problem .	Homer Simpson
now we 're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours ...	Marge Simpson
so do your farting now .	Homer Simpson
homie ! what if that was the last thing you ever said ?	Marge Simpson
do n't worry . my last words will be `` i can outrun that lion . ''	Homer Simpson
all right , everybody in !	Homer Simpson
all right , who 's the wisenheimer that 's been eating the powdered food ?	Marge Simpson
not me .	Bart Simpson
two can play at that game .	Homer Simpson
i can do this ... i can do this ...	Homer Simpson
boy , i told you an hour ago . stop that !	Homer Simpson
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !	Bart Simpson
do we really have to sit here the whole time ? i mean , if we went out now , it might be cool to see the town empty .	Lisa Simpson
yeah ! i could sneak into the school and write whatever i want on the chalkboard !	Bart Simpson
i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana !	Lisa Simpson
and i can drive drunk while i 'm actually sober !	Homer Simpson
it 's fun , but not as fun .	Homer Simpson
that 's odd .	Marge Simpson
why are all those cars parked at city hall ?	Marge Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
if i did n't know better , i 'd say it was a town meeting .	Lisa Simpson
not without us , it is n't ! pull over .	Marge Simpson
what 's going on ? why is there a picture of us ? this is n't good .	Marge Simpson
oh honey , why must you always assume that a huge picture of us , at a secret meeting we were n't told about , is a bad thing ?	Homer Simpson
moe , it 's me , marge ! i 'm your friend !	Marge Simpson
why would you want to banish us from springfield ?	Lisa Simpson
yeah . we 're like family to you . i 'm talking to you , headphone-bus driver guy .	Homer Simpson
why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family ? what have we done that 's so terrible ?	Marge Simpson
we won ! woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
homer ! that is not banishment-hearing behavior !	Marge Simpson
if i may speak .	Marge Simpson
we 're not monsters . we 're just people . people who love each other and love this town . the only place we 've ever called home . thank you .	Marge Simpson
thank you .	Marge Simpson
now , now , now just a second here ! now , i know we 're not perfect . but , uh , i believe it was sammy hagar who said --	Homer Simpson
i always thought `` tarred and feathered '' was just a figure of speech .	Homer Simpson
good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now !	Homer Simpson
wait ! if you banish us , you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought .	Homer Simpson
i mean a thousand-year flood !	Homer Simpson
i mean a thousand years of perfect weather .	Homer Simpson
that was the last springfield radio station . now we just get shelbyville talk radio .	Marge Simpson
soda , eh ?	Homer Simpson
dad , where are we going ? do we have a plan ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , let 's face it . i 'm the one that 's brought this fate upon us . and there 's only one way out : i 've got ta man up . okay , manning up ... manning up . mannning -- girling down ! girling down !	Homer Simpson
hey , henrietta hippo , i 've got to drain the inchworm .	Bart Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
please . put that down .	Homer Simpson
i just got started !	Bart Simpson
not you ! him !	Homer Simpson
please sir , we 've been thrown out of a place we 've always called home . we just wan na live out our lives in peace .	Marge Simpson
we found a new home ! when god shuts a door , he opens a window .	Homer Simpson
eh , i 'm sick of watching fox . let 's get some fresh air . i got the atv 's right out back .	Homer Simpson
should i get my helmet ?	Bart Simpson
helmet ? that 's springfield talk .	Homer Simpson
is there gas in these ?	Bart Simpson
springfield talk !	Homer Simpson
well how are we supposed to get fuel ?	Bart Simpson
private plane crashes .	Homer Simpson
ahhh , smell that unpolluted air ! y'know , i 'm glad we 're in exile .	Lisa Simpson
yep , i never realized how much i hated every single one of my friends and relatives .	Homer Simpson
i do n't think this place is so great .	Marge Simpson
i 'm trying to make the best of things , but i 'm worried maggie is falling in with a bad crowd .	Marge Simpson
i miss our home and i want to go back .	Marge Simpson
it 's not perfect here , but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind , wikileaks is right over there .	Lisa Simpson
how 're you doin ' , mr. assange ?	Bart Simpson
is it iraqi journalists being murdered ?	Marge Simpson
well i 've got a really big secret for you ... i 'm not wearing any underwear .	Homer Simpson
he 's no ned flanders . and i miss the springfield sign and how every street is a dead end . god help me , i even miss helen lovejoy criticizing my brownies .	Marge Simpson
hey baby , banned forever does n't mean you ca n't go back sometimes .	Homer Simpson
yes it does .	Bart Simpson
pipe down , boy . i 'm sneaking you back into springfield .	Homer Simpson
oh , `` smithers '' !	Homer Simpson
homie , these disguises wo n't fool anyone .	Marge Simpson
pish tosh , smithers , and fiddle-dee-dee ! nailed it !	Homer Simpson
excellent .	Homer Simpson
you know what 's great about you , marge ? after all these years you can still shinny up the donut , and then pull me up after you .	Homer Simpson
look ! a shooting star !	Marge Simpson
do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets ?	Homer Simpson
on a night like tonight i have to believe there are .	Marge Simpson
strike ! woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
wan na make out over the foul line ?	Marge Simpson
ever since the day we met .	Homer Simpson
the old homestead . remember when we moved in and i talked like this ?	Homer Simpson
there 's no sex like fugitive sex .	Homer Simpson
someone 's downstairs !	Homer Simpson
all right ! you caught us . what are you gon na do about it ? throw us out of town again ?	Homer Simpson
we hate opera !	Homer Simpson
nooo !	Homer Simpson
do n't even bother shooting us . we 've found a new place that we love . a place that may not have indoor plumbing , but it 's got something we treasure more ...	Marge Simpson
yeah . non-jerks !	Homer Simpson
well , i 've tightened the bolt ! i think we 're good !	Homer Simpson
you sure this is a good idea ?	Bart Simpson
this is the outlands , boy . ideas are n't good or bad , they 're just free ! power on !	Homer Simpson
i was wrong , there are bad ideas ! there are terrible ideas !	Homer Simpson
now i 'm over here !	Homer Simpson
i 'm on it .	Bart Simpson
lenny lenford . you 're a long way from your barstool .	Bart Simpson
hey lenny , welcome aboard .	Homer Simpson
now , i got ta warn you , if you find a little black thing on your pillow , it wo n't be a mint .	Homer Simpson
let her slice off the tip of your ear , and she 'll go right to sleep .	Homer Simpson
that 's not a choice you get to make .	Homer Simpson
forget it . we do n't need some big city bartender chargin ' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves .	Homer Simpson
well , i rented that plane .	Homer Simpson
what are you doing here ?	Marge Simpson
true , true .	Homer Simpson
stop ! stop ! this is everything we put behind us !	Marge Simpson
well , i did miss a few things about the grid ... like everything !	Lisa Simpson
maureen dowd , we 've got a lot of catching up to do .	Lisa Simpson
come on , man , we would n't leave you behind .	Bart Simpson
accident ! here comes another one !	Bart Simpson
dad ? dad ?	Lisa Simpson
yes ! awake ! let 's do this !	Homer Simpson
dad , i wanted to give you a heads-up . mom 's birthday is tomorrow . it 's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that 's not completely insulting .	Lisa Simpson
you know sweetie , there was a time when i would 've killed for that information , but i 'm pleased to announce i 've already bought your mother a present .	Homer Simpson
and brace yourself : i put some thought into it .	Homer Simpson
it 's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper .	Homer Simpson
wha -- ? mom is gon na love that !	Lisa Simpson
love ? ! your mom 's gon na feel so good it 'll make mere `` love '' seem like chewing tinfoil . because today i 'm getting it autographed .	Homer Simpson
by who ? lenny ?	Lisa Simpson
by the box lady herself !	Homer Simpson
yeah .	Homer Simpson
man , oh man , look at this place ! finally , a supermarket with a clear premise : island something .	Homer Simpson
it 's like going to hawaii without the murderous locals !	Bart Simpson
they have jellies made of fruits i 've never heard of !	Lisa Simpson
these 'll go great with betel nut butter !	Lisa Simpson
wow . i do n't believe the simpsons will be shopping at the kwik-e-mart anymore .	Homer Simpson
apu ! what are you doing out of your natural habitat ?	Homer Simpson
but at the kwik-e-mart , the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register .	Lisa Simpson
friends are the only people you can betray ! and you 'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples !	Homer Simpson
would you sign this for my wife marge ? she 's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow .	Homer Simpson
you would do that ? oh my god , this might be a marge 's birthday where i get sex !	Homer Simpson
ooh ! an apron with a sonnet !	Marge Simpson
open mine ! quick , before it suffocates !	Bart Simpson
a bunny ! just like the one i had when i was a girl ! how did you know ?	Marge Simpson

i saw this picture at grandma 's house , then i hit the pet stores till i found one that looked just like it .	Bart Simpson
oh bart , you got me the fluffy pet i 've never stopped thinking about !	Marge Simpson
now , last but not least , your present , homie .	Marge Simpson
wait one sec , marge . before you open it , you 're gon na get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever .	Homer Simpson
well , we 're still focused on me instead of watching golf , so that 's pretty good .	Marge Simpson
the only golf we 'll watch is ladies ' golf , and we 're not watching that . now in three ... two ... one ...	Homer Simpson
i repeat . one ...	Homer Simpson
onnnnnnneee ...	Homer Simpson
... onnneee ... onnneee ...	Homer Simpson
please do n't say one again .	Marge Simpson

well , at least you remembered i like her .	Marge Simpson
a pity kiss ? ! that tears it ! i 'm gon na call that paula paul and give her a piece of my mind !	Homer Simpson

wait ! maybe paula paul left a message .	Lisa Simpson
i think that 's enough birthday fun .	Marge Simpson
why you little ... i 'm gon na get ... no , homer . you ca n't strangle a boy on his mother 's birthday . juries hate that . so instead , boy , i want you to ... get in that rabbit cage !	Homer Simpson
no way , man ! i 'm a free-range kid !	Bart Simpson
no backtalk ! in the cage ! now !	Homer Simpson
get in there !	Homer Simpson
son , do you have a minute ?	Homer Simpson

i like it in the cage . these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress .	Bart Simpson

but it 's my home now , sir .	Bart Simpson
i 'll poke a broom in there ! you know i 'm capable of it !	Homer Simpson
fine .	Bart Simpson

mr. burns , before i leave , i 've got a few things to get off my chest : one : i liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push `` popcorn '' . you do n't have to know how long . two : replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable . three : how about a farewell party with a caricature artist ? you know , it 's something both kids and adults can enjoy . so to sum up : nicely-done , we hate you , and food for thought .	Homer Simpson

sorry . before we die , can you tell me how old you really are ?	Homer Simpson
guys , thank you . the words `` prime directive '' get thrown around a lot these days , but i 'm glad yours was saving me . the saddest part is none of this had to happen , if mr. burns had simply trusted the human worker . or if someone , anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings .	Homer Simpson
and his arm can be my back-scratcher .	Homer Simpson
i 'm giving you your wish : to be a real boy .	Homer Simpson

the lava being ! that 's why they showed a clip of it on `` previously on . ''	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
you 're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago ? and when i wanted to watch it with you then , you said it was pretentious and repetitive !	Marge Simpson
marge , there 're so many mysteries that i need to have solved .	Homer Simpson
now , if the korean couple ca n't speak english , why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was `` enigma '' spelled backwards ? what does it mean ?	Homer Simpson
it means use the treadmill for running or take it back !	Marge Simpson
and where will i watch tv ?	Homer Simpson

okay , we 'll go to my second choice .	Bart Simpson
now you be careful with bart 's undies .	Marge Simpson
you 're a bully ?	Bart Simpson
thank you all for coming to my `` stranded '' discussion group !	Homer Simpson

spoiler !	Homer Simpson
spoil-er !	Homer Simpson
homer , for god sakes , i 'm trying to put maggie to sleep !	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , sweetie . it 's just a strandie discussion group . yes it is ! we discuss why airplane go crash-crash , but people do n't die-die .	Homer Simpson
you wan na know what happens on your stupid show ? firstly , the `` mysterious island '' is fifteen miles from long beach . also , doorway three led to hell despite the series creators ' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell , and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box !	Marge Simpson
thanks , marge . you ruined my show . now i 'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage : it 's not great right now .	Homer Simpson
man , they have every entrance covered . you 'd have to be a navy seal to get in or out .	Bart Simpson
hello , lovebirds .	Lisa Simpson
what are you doing here ?	Bart Simpson
i 've been following your storyline from afar , bart , waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you could n't get out of . perhaps i could broker a settlement .	Lisa Simpson
hear , hear !	Lisa Simpson
i do n't think shauna should choose any of you . shauna should choose shauna .	Lisa Simpson
you do n't want me ?	Bart Simpson
well , that is one lucky creepy guy .	Bart Simpson
lisa , are you out there in your slippers ? come inside !	Marge Simpson
well bart , i guess that 's our cue to skedaddle ...	Lisa Simpson
lousy marge ... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his tv show ... i 'd tell my best friend , but that 's marge too ...	Homer Simpson
homie , come in the bedroom .	Marge Simpson
care to join me in a private `` last episode party '' ?	Marge Simpson
well ...	Homer Simpson
it 's okay , dad . he 's just putting the fear of god in me .	Bart Simpson
okay , but if this house starts a-rockin ' , do n't come a-knockin ' .	Homer Simpson
monday ... here we go again ...	Bart Simpson
sorry kid , but there comes a day when that just does n't do anything anymore .	Bart Simpson
want , want , want , want , want , want , want , want , want !	Bart Simpson
want !	Bart Simpson
mom , dad , do you know there 's a boat out there where nothing sucks ? it 's called royalty cruises and royalty cruise specialists are standing by now !	Bart Simpson
i 'm sorry , sweetie . maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot did n't pick up the tab for his buddies at `` mr . steak . ''	Marge Simpson
again with `` mr . steak ! '' do you know why i go to mr. steak ? because at mr. steak they do n't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at mr. steak !	Homer Simpson
well of course they do n't .	Marge Simpson
why do n't you talk to mrs. steak ?	Homer Simpson
there is no mrs. steak . who could stay married to such a man .	Marge Simpson
okay ... maybe i can pay for the cruise . let 's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck , no porthole , group z lifeboat access ... it 's still a ton of money .	Bart Simpson
and there 's a dvd library of movies that have n't been released yet !	Bart Simpson
face it , we 're just kids . we ca n't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices . all we have in the world are the things our parents give us .	Lisa Simpson
bart ! there 's a really mean squirrel in the back yard . i need you to dare me to fight him !	Homer Simpson
bart 's been raptured ! and his crap 's been craptured !	Homer Simpson
i sold all my stuff , and it 's still not enough money for the cruise .	Bart Simpson
just try to enjoy your dinner , sweetie .	Marge Simpson
i ca n't , i sold my `` dinner futures . ''	Bart Simpson
nice doin ' business with you , boy .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
it 's okay . i do n't have much of an appetite tonight . i 'm going to floor .	Bart Simpson
mooooom ! daaaaaad !	Bart Simpson
i woke up and the money jar was full ! that means the devil accepted my bargain . now to uphold my end of the deal !	Bart Simpson
snowball ii !	Bart Simpson
no . we saw how much this cruise means to you , so we all sold something special . and we made just enough for an economy cabin !	Marge Simpson
i sold a couple of my rare jazz records . after a while they all start to sound the same . still love the genre , of course . not even close to getting sick of it .	Lisa Simpson
and i sold our good china .	Marge Simpson
really ? ! but that 's been in your family for generations ...	Bart Simpson
yeah ... actually , my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for . it took her years to get the whole set .	Marge Simpson
and dad donated something , too .	Lisa Simpson
what happened to my mini-pool table ? i was training to be a mini-pool hustler .	Homer Simpson
we sold it to pay for a family cruise !	Marge Simpson
i never even got to realize this jacket was too small .	Homer Simpson
it 's weird to hear myself saying this , but ... i love you guys . this is gon na be the best vacation ever !	Bart Simpson
oh , marge ... your names ...	Homer Simpson
yeah , for you kids maybe . for dads , a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job ! `` are you wearing enough sun block ? '' `` is that splashing or drowning ? ''	Homer Simpson
why does every sand castle require my participation ?	Homer Simpson
then a kid disappears and it 's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar ...	Homer Simpson
... eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger ! which he drops in the water !	Homer Simpson
and here 's the worst part : i never get any time alone with my wife because we 're all sleeping in the same room !	Homer Simpson
look , that 's our ship !	Bart Simpson
what ? !	Bart Simpson
i can offer you a cabin on our sugar-free fitness cruise ...	Bart Simpson
well , well , mr. never-wrong was right again -- family vacations always suck . i called it . called . it .	Lisa Simpson
homer ! this is bad for you , too !	Marge Simpson
worth it to be ri-ight ! worth it to be ri-ight !	Homer Simpson
upgrade !	Bart Simpson

well , you 're all invited , so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres .	Marge Simpson
they have itchy and scratchy weddings ?	Lisa Simpson

maggie knows how to keep a secret . why ca n't you ?	Bart Simpson
bart , is there something you want to tell us ?	Marge Simpson
oh marge , let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies .	Homer Simpson
that is totally irresponsible parenting !	Marge Simpson
not according to the internet !	Homer Simpson
where on the internet ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me .	Homer Simpson
why would you believe him ?	Marge Simpson
because his avatar is darth maul ! the second-coolest darth !	Homer Simpson
and what he says is true because it 's in all caps . are you gon na argue with caps ?	Homer Simpson
ned , i realized long ago , there are some things homer and i will never completely agree on .	Marge Simpson
yeah , but we make sure never to go to bed hungry .	Homer Simpson
it 's angry .	Marge Simpson

`` lisa does n't judge other people . why should we judge her ? '' it 's signed , `` truth teller . ''	Bart Simpson
whoever this `` truth teller '' is , i 'm a fan . it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously .	Marge Simpson

yep . message boards are never wrong .	Lisa Simpson
dutch ?	Lisa Simpson
forgive a fool her tears .	Lisa Simpson

i appreciate that .	Homer Simpson
look , if i could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up , i think i might have a chance to ...	Lisa Simpson
hey , why do n't we go see lady gaga ? that 'll turn your frown upside down .	Homer Simpson

lady gaga , meet your biggest threat : baby googoo .	Bart Simpson
can i please be alone ?	Lisa Simpson
well , it worked once .	Lisa Simpson
i never have any idea what to do for lisa . to be the mother of someone who 's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument i do n't really care for . it 's so hard .	Marge Simpson
i wish i was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry , 'cause it does n't work for me .	Marge Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson

lisa , can you come down ?	Homer Simpson
sweetie , i 've been thinking . now , this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself . the problem 's not that you were cheating ... it 's that you got caught .	Homer Simpson
i cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death . so , honey , what do you say ?	Homer Simpson
dad , thank you . like always , the fact that i could tune you out without fearing i 'd miss out on something , gave me the time to take stock , and realize how ungrateful i have been . which means i 've got a train to catch .	Lisa Simpson
parenting . it 's the one job you always know you 're doing right .	Homer Simpson
gaga !	Lisa Simpson
to thank you !	Lisa Simpson
look at me ! you did help me , by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you . it was like a great sneeze . and now i can say what 's good about me . and i can say it as lisa simpson ! just not that loud .	Lisa Simpson
well , i 'm smart , nice , tolerant , funny but not `` mean funny , '' and i never forget a birthday , even for kids who move away .	Lisa Simpson
i 'll do anything but sing !	Lisa Simpson
i used to think that i was stupid , worthless , weak , and wrong	Lisa Simpson
a mockingbird without a song ...	Lisa Simpson

and why is that ?	Bart Simpson
mom , can we go to new york to find this girl i used to know ?	Bart Simpson
bart , that 's sweet , but we 'd need airplane money , hotel money ...	Marge Simpson
... and five hundred dollars for yankee tickets , which turn out to be bogus ...	Homer Simpson
well , do n't buy 'em !	Bart Simpson
but they 're playing the purple sox !	Homer Simpson
c'mon , dad . you love new york . now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .	Bart Simpson
lousy outdated relics ! boy , do you remember what happened the last time we went to new york ?	Homer Simpson
you 're dead , j.j. get yourself buried !	Homer Simpson
i 'm about to go owl shooting ... and you just said `` who ! ''	Homer Simpson
you 're sellin ' milk , j.j. , and i 've got a sour stomach .	Homer Simpson
homer , that sounds like `` the sweet smell of success '' .	Marge Simpson
it did n't feel like success .	Homer Simpson
why , ladies ? why ? !	Bart Simpson
we 're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here .	Bart Simpson
son , you can dial down the crazy . your mother and i talked about it and we found a way to get to new york . it 's all set , boy . to save money , we 're swapping houses .	Homer Simpson
but do n't the people wreck your house when they stay in it ?	Bart Simpson
i did n't say i swapped our house .	Homer Simpson
look at this place . things have certainly changed since our ancestor fievel came here .	Homer Simpson
fievel was a mouse in a movie .	Lisa Simpson
yes , and now look at us . only in america .	Homer Simpson
oh , geez . not this guy , with his stupid little pushcart .	Homer Simpson
come on , let 's go find mary ! this is the address her brother gave me .	Bart Simpson
ca n't dad take bart while we seek out culture ?	Lisa Simpson
you do that .	Homer Simpson
do you know you 're missing your clothes ?	Homer Simpson
all right , i 'll spring for a cab .	Homer Simpson
much better .	Homer Simpson
hey !	Bart Simpson
oh-oh-oh oh , thank god you woke up !	Homer Simpson
i guess my search for true love is doomed .	Bart Simpson
you 've learned a very valuable life lesson , boy , which is that love does n't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage . after that , it 's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you , but you ca n't get it together to leave . i 'll get us some ice cream .	Homer Simpson
thanks for asking , duchess . i 'm sittin ' here waitin ' for a girl that 's never gon na show up .	Bart Simpson
girls do n't like me . i do n't really like them yet either , but i think i 'm gon na . there 's a storm a-brewin ' down there .	Bart Simpson
wow . what are you doin ' for money ?	Bart Simpson
let 's talk about somethin ' else . something nice .	Bart Simpson
so , this is basically what we can afford .	Marge Simpson
well , at least i 'll be able to say i went to a broadway show .	Lisa Simpson
oh , forget it .	Marge Simpson
yeah ... plus i thought i might get to see an air conditioner fall on someone 's head . but i guess that never really happens .	Bart Simpson
why you little ... where 's that ice cream ?	Homer Simpson
just once i 'd like your father to be on a jumbotron for something good .	Marge Simpson
damn you and your fluted neck !	Homer Simpson
i thought there was no crime in new york any more . giulianiii !	Homer Simpson
they let sideshow bob out of prison again .	Bart Simpson
huh . did n't know they still ran those trains .	Bart Simpson
trying to find high culture at low prices .	Bart Simpson
no , lisa ! if you click that turnstile , it 'll blow our budget !	Marge Simpson
i could listen to your twang all day .	Bart Simpson
can i do a rap in the middle of it ?	Bart Simpson
rollin ' on my skateboard / pimpin ' like a drug lord ...	Bart Simpson
all right , broadway 's too expensive , the museums are over-curated -- but shakespeare in the park is tonight , and the tickets are free !	Lisa Simpson
la-dies-and-gen-tle-men-i-have-an-an-nounce-ment . that 's not iambic pentameter !	Marge Simpson
not so fast ! we came for shakespeare , and we 're gon na see shakespeare !	Lisa Simpson
anyone who wants to be in this , grab a doublet and meet me backstage !	Lisa Simpson
i was thinking amateurs only .	Lisa Simpson
fine , you 're in .	Lisa Simpson
oh , for the love of god .	Lisa Simpson
our search for culture is thus concluded / for the bard of avon is well-suited / to a crowd with ev'ry cell phone muted / jeez , i ca n't stop talking like this .	Marge Simpson
hey , do n't ever stop , because tonight we made it in new york !	Lisa Simpson
um ... i 've got ta go .	Bart Simpson
go where ?	Homer Simpson
uh , well , since we 're here , i 'm gon na go try to get al roker 's autograph .	Bart Simpson
um ... i 'm gon na go try to sell this .	Bart Simpson
i ca n't .	Bart Simpson
boy , you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't , because mary 's the girl that proves that girls can like me . and she would n't like me anymore if i gave her up . so i wo n't , even if you torture me like you do the english language .	Bart Simpson
thanks , man .	Bart Simpson
aw , look at that -- my little guy 's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be .	Homer Simpson
well at least it did n't end as bad as `` romeo and juliet . ''	Marge Simpson
heh , no kidding , i saw your reviews .	Homer Simpson
hey ! i specifically said no critics ! this is outrageous ! ooh , but they like me !	Lisa Simpson
i hope you enjoyed the show tonight . and if you 're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head , rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of .	Homer Simpson
but we 're here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag .	Lisa Simpson
the best submission will be animated and appear on the show !	Bart Simpson
do we screw them on the credit ?	Homer Simpson
no ! for details , log onto thesimpsons.com .	Marge Simpson
i 'm submitting mine now .	Bart Simpson
at least the pennant works both ways .	Homer Simpson
huh ?	Lisa Simpson
a mini black hole !	Lisa Simpson
oh no , i 've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it !	Lisa Simpson
lisa ! do you have a stray dog down there ?	Homer Simpson
um , it 's a lot worse than a stray dog .	Lisa Simpson
two stray dogs ?	Homer Simpson
it 's a black hole !	Lisa Simpson
that was gon na be my next guess !	Homer Simpson
are you sure your next guess was n't `` three stray dogs ? ''	Lisa Simpson
maybe .	Homer Simpson
a black hole ? i 'm sorry , can we call it that ?	Homer Simpson
yes , it 's the preferred term . and most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out . but some think they may be a gateway to other universes .	Lisa Simpson
hey , can it open a pretzel bag for me ? help a brother out , b.h .	Homer Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson
guys , stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in , the bigger and more dangerous it becomes !	Lisa Simpson
come on , you ca n't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something !	Homer Simpson
dad , do n't pat it !	Lisa Simpson
why should --	Homer Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
i am nature 's perfect choking machine !	Homer Simpson
okay , that 's it ! i 'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole , and do n't throw anything more into it ! uh-oh , yes , homer .	Marge Simpson
dad , that 's creepy .	Lisa Simpson
sorry .	Homer Simpson
i know we should n't feed this , but grease brings raccoons .	Marge Simpson
quit bageling my english muffins !	Marge Simpson
the black hole is looking a lot bigger . does anybody want to admit to throwing things in ?	Lisa Simpson
nope . / not me . / do we even still have that thing ?	Homer Simpson
and i have to ask ... has anyone seen the cat ?	Lisa Simpson
now what ?	Marge Simpson
okay , it 's possible that someone may have started a business called `` magic craphole waste removal , '' but it was n't me .	Homer Simpson
stop ! this is a black hole , not a lawn and leaf bag ! if one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass !	Lisa Simpson
noooo !	Lisa Simpson
treasures ? gifts ? you got it all wrong . that stuff is just our old --	Homer Simpson
wonderful stuff ! enjoy it !	Marge Simpson
day one .	Homer Simpson
we 've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night .	Homer Simpson
and if anyone finds this footage after we 're all missing or dead , remember me as a hero .	Homer Simpson
dad , you forgot to pick me up after little league !	Bart Simpson
you tossed your car keys in my bean plant !	Lisa Simpson
a hero .	Homer Simpson
hero away !	Homer Simpson
night one . wan na snuggle ?	Homer Simpson
not with the camera on .	Marge Simpson
i turned it off .	Homer Simpson
looks like the red light 's on .	Marge Simpson
i swear , i am not filming .	Homer Simpson
note to self : edit out my lies .	Homer Simpson
wait ! do n't kill the monster without me !	Homer Simpson
i 'm right behind you , honey ! we have stairs ? !	Homer Simpson
what the ?	Homer Simpson
why is this happening to us ?	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know , i do n't know ! i 'm sure i do n't know !	Marge Simpson
oh , sweetie , sometimes a mysterious , invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them . now go to bed .	Homer Simpson
but --	Lisa Simpson
eh-eh , school night .	Homer Simpson
now you 're sure i bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost ?	Homer Simpson
ooh , i ca n't wait for tonight 's massacre .	Homer Simpson
hey , marge .	Homer Simpson
oh , like what you see , huh ?	Homer Simpson
i like it when you do n't say words .	Homer Simpson
come here , you . /	Marge Simpson
give back my baby !	Marge Simpson
mom , what 's going on ?	Lisa Simpson
let 's see what we 're dealin ' with here .	Bart Simpson
it 's moe with wings !	Lisa Simpson
i brought this on us all . it began when i was a girl ...	Marge Simpson
i thought i was the favorite .	Lisa Simpson
not the favorite ! not the favorite !	Lisa Simpson
listen , pal , you seem like an honest guy .	Homer Simpson
is there any other deal that you can accept ?	Homer Simpson
you , me and marge ?	Homer Simpson
i guess it 's one of those things a dad has to do ...	Homer Simpson
now , before we start , what 's the safe word ?	Homer Simpson
ooh , i like that . now , i 'd like to try something new if you do n't mind ...	Homer Simpson
cinnamon !	Homer Simpson
y'know , it 's really not fair you 're charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover !	Bart Simpson
that 's impossible !	Bart Simpson
or is it ?	Bart Simpson
nineteen seventy-four ! i wo n't be needing this .	Bart Simpson
now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one 's mad at george lucas .	Bart Simpson
eh , pretty good . a little preachy .	Bart Simpson
it 's homer ! before his boobs came in !	Bart Simpson
hey , homer .	Bart Simpson
i 'm your unwanted son from the future , who killed all your fun !	Bart Simpson
would you go to the prom with me ?	Homer Simpson
it was not love at first sight !	Marge Simpson
ay carumba ! if you guys do n't get together ... what does that mean for me in the future ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't exist ?	Bart Simpson
or ... my life might be a hell of a lot better !	Bart Simpson
ma'am , whatever you do , do not marry that ape .	Bart Simpson
now to return to a future where i 'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy 's house . either way , better than now .	Bart Simpson
here 's your smoothie , sweetheart .	Marge Simpson
my dad is artie ziff ?	Bart Simpson
oy carumba !	Bart Simpson
achem !	Lisa Simpson
give yourself a wedgie .	Bart Simpson
i love my life . i love it not . i love my life . i love it not .	Bart Simpson
i 'll tell you what i 'm doing , i 'm realizing that i married the wrong man . oh , you poor , sweet , simple homers .	Marge Simpson
i was supposed to be with all of you .	Marge Simpson
even you , caveman homer .	Marge Simpson
well , cardinal or cannibal , i wish that twenty years ago i had chosen love .	Marge Simpson
lem me get this straight . none of you had time to take out the garbage ?	Marge Simpson
hummingbirds ! hum and get it !	Marge Simpson
homie , the faucet is dripping .	Marge Simpson
i 'll get right on it .	Homer Simpson
homer , when are you going to fix this faucet ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm on it !	Homer Simpson
are you going to fix the faucet or not ?	Marge Simpson
for the third time this year , yes !	Homer Simpson
`` i 'll get to it , marge ... '' `` i 'll get to it ... '' when we first got married , he 'd only take six months to do things ...	Marge Simpson
mom , how come you did n't do my homework last night ?	Bart Simpson
oh no ! lisa 's face ... it 's the same !	Bart Simpson
everyone relax . i think i 've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere .	Marge Simpson
oh , man -- i got ta climb stairs ? forget it .	Bart Simpson
no one stays in the sinkhole !	Marge Simpson
lousy surface dwellers ...	Bart Simpson

that guy has a bone to pick with the board of regents . hey , lisa 's not getting on the bus .	Bart Simpson
i do n't know . dork farm ? who cares ?	Bart Simpson
fine . we 'll follow her .	Bart Simpson
the five boxing wizards jump quickly ? whoa ! my sister 's finally become ... mildly interesting !	Bart Simpson
no , i 'm here to buy one myself .	Marge Simpson
this car looks a little small . is the engine powerful ?	Marge Simpson
well , that 's odd , because the consumer website says the rx-12 2-cylinder has a dealer 's invoice of fourteen seven .	Marge Simpson
this says you are the manager .	Marge Simpson
it says on your facebook page you have no kids .	Marge Simpson
i got ta hand it to you , marge . you got the exact amount of car for our family . room for two adults , three kids , and zero grampas .	Homer Simpson
uh-oh ! do you hear that rattle ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't hear anything .	Bart Simpson
me neither .	Lisa Simpson
and what 's that smell ?	Marge Simpson
i think it 's `` new car smell . ''	Lisa Simpson
well i do n't like it .	Marge Simpson
i still smell it !	Marge Simpson
darn car wo n't start .	Marge Simpson
let automobile von bismarck give it a try .	Homer Simpson
well ...	Homer Simpson
hmm . well , it would n't start for me . i think this car 's a lemon !	Marge Simpson
... the wipers wipe backwards , and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together ! excuse me .	Marge Simpson
so , you 're not totally unqualified .	Homer Simpson
a reason ? what could it be ?	Homer Simpson
wow , an auto mechanic who tells the truth .	Homer Simpson
umm ... no thanks .	Homer Simpson
marge ... do you think maybe there 's another reason you do n't like this car ? um ... um ... a `` feelings '' reason ?	Homer Simpson
what are you talking about ?	Marge Simpson
well , maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot . when do you think things first went wrong ?	Homer Simpson
all right , i remember we all got in ... and by the way , that backseat is pretty tight for the kids . i mean , i do n't know what we 'd do if we had another baby . with this car , we 're basically saying no more babies !	Marge Simpson
no , no , marge . i want you to explore your feelings .	Homer Simpson
homer , the reason i hate this car is ... i think i want another baby !	Marge Simpson
an `` on purpose '' baby ?	Homer Simpson
i do !	Marge Simpson
homie , i want another baby .	Marge Simpson
what about ... you know ... `` stinky '' ?	Homer Simpson
maggie 's not a baby ! her soft spot 's been skulled over for the last three months ! being a mom is who i am , and i 'm not done being who i am .	Marge Simpson
whatever you want , sweetie .	Homer Simpson
well , take a shower , 'cause we 're gon na try it tonight !	Marge Simpson
homer , why do you take a three second pause before you answer what i say ?	Marge Simpson
just appreciating how lucky i am to be with you .	Homer Simpson
what a wonderful thought .	Marge Simpson
boxing wizards . boxing wizards . what 's she up to ?	Bart Simpson
maybe i should go on anti-psychotic meds .	Bart Simpson
bart ! what are you doing in my room ? !	Lisa Simpson
lowering your blinds . i 'd hate for your carpet to fade .	Bart Simpson
what are you doing tuesdays and thursdays after school ?	Bart Simpson
what do you do tuesdays and thursdays after school ?	Lisa Simpson
write stupid stuff on the chalkboard . and if you have any ideas , i 'm really running out . today 's was `` mousetraps are not slippers '' or something . now what are you up to ?	Bart Simpson
a gentleman does n't ask and a lady does n't tell .	Lisa Simpson
can i use that on the chalkboard ?	Bart Simpson
i guess .	Lisa Simpson
gentleman does n't ask , lady does n't tell . now all i need is one for martin luther king day .	Bart Simpson
my husband and i have been snuggling six ways from sunday ...	Marge Simpson
and let me tell you , a towel rack will not support your weight .	Homer Simpson
... but we are n't making a baby . i thought we should check , to make sure homer has ... you know , working stunt-men in his cannon .	Marge Simpson
what do you mean ?	Marge Simpson
x 's for eyes ...	Homer Simpson
i guess ... that 's that , then .	Marge Simpson
honey , i am so sorry . i guess we 'll just have to learn to love the three children we have .	Homer Simpson
hey , uh ... hm ... why do n't we take the longer but nicer historic route ? then today will be nothing but beautiful memories .	Homer Simpson
lisa 's going somewhere after school two days a week . and all we have are boxing wizards . if we 're gon na find out what lisa 's up to , i 'll need the help of all her old boyfriends .	Bart Simpson
way over . we got ta save that poor girl . anyone know how we get home ?	Bart Simpson
i ca n't believe we 're never going to have another child ...	Marge Simpson
sorry guys . private family moment .	Homer Simpson
no , s'okay . we can share this with you ... homer ca n't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers .	Marge Simpson
eh , nothing we can do .	Homer Simpson
you never told me about that .	Marge Simpson
it 's true ... that 's how i got the money to buy you your necklace .	Homer Simpson
awww ... eww ... homie ! we still have a chance !	Marge Simpson
i , uh , hope it 's twins !	Homer Simpson
now i 'm thinking alex if it 's a girl and xander if it 's a boy .	Marge Simpson
okay .	Marge Simpson
watch it !	Homer Simpson
ooh , a christmas ornament museum ! can we stop ?	Marge Simpson
okay , but just for a minute . we want to hit the candle store , fudgerama , the zipper hall of fame , snow globe world , and the taj meatball .	Homer Simpson
i think that shiva used to be paul bunyan .	Marge Simpson
i know why they 're here !	Lisa Simpson
because they ca n't let me have a secret . it drives them crazy .	Lisa Simpson
cursive writing . i 'm learning cursive . all these sentences have every letter of the alphabet in them .	Lisa Simpson
i hope you 're happy . you all just wasted your time working your way into an afterschool class .	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't believe we spent the whole day here .	Marge Simpson
and i got to try every flavor of candy cane : white and red .	Homer Simpson
well , maybe we should check into a motel .	Marge Simpson
ooh , homie , you 've lost weight .	Marge Simpson
what 's that , baby ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll take it from here , wing-man .	Homer Simpson
it sure was nice to have a day together as a couple .	Marge Simpson
yeah , no kids to ruin it .	Homer Simpson
i thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby .	Marge Simpson
marge , i was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda .	Homer Simpson
so , you do n't want another baby ? how long have you felt this way ?	Marge Simpson
uh , well , looking back , i guess it started sometime before bart was born .	Homer Simpson
room for one , please .	Homer Simpson
honey , i 'm sorry . it 's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids .	Homer Simpson
emotionally , financially , the boy ... i just did n't know how to tell you .	Homer Simpson
just yell across the house like you do everything else !	Marge Simpson
okay , good , we 're talking ...	Homer Simpson
we 're not talking !	Marge Simpson
your phone just dialed me .	Homer Simpson
you were pocket-dialed !	Marge Simpson
hey , the pocket wants what it wants .	Homer Simpson
they just leave the maple syrup on the table , huh ? how about that ? that 's trust , huh ?	Homer Simpson
shush !	Marge Simpson
uh-oh . i do n't think i rewound the video the last time i was here .	Homer Simpson
um , i 'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a simpson , homer . or it may be under the name thad supersperm .	Homer Simpson
homer ... homer , this is the point where i really have to know what you want .	Marge Simpson
i 'll tell you what i want , marge . i want to make another simpson . the table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three . cubes are made of cheese , but pyramids are schemes . and anything that 's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect .	Homer Simpson
are you sure there is n't more ? i mean there 's always a little ketchup left in the bottle .	Homer Simpson
i 'd like to buy back my sample .	Homer Simpson
well , i expected a little argument .	Homer Simpson
geez . i mean , i 'm no luis guzman , but i 'm all right .	Homer Simpson
homer ? how many samples did you sell ?	Marge Simpson
um ... remember that corvette i had ?	Homer Simpson
i thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip .	Marge Simpson
this is the worst pain imaginable !	Homer Simpson
exactly . well , we 're all set . let 's make a thad supersperm junior . with a name like that , he could be president .	Homer Simpson
homie , maybe we should wait .	Marge Simpson
maybe there 's enough homer in the world for now .	Marge Simpson
but i was really looking forward to ...	Homer Simpson
you 're right , marge . i do n't wan na bring more kids into a world full of my kids .	Homer Simpson
two adults , please .	Homer Simpson
another thing that would be harder with four kids .	Homer Simpson
you know , i always send the theater manager a check the next day .	Marge Simpson
pushy sign ! do n't tell me what to try !	Homer Simpson
i do n't recall that .	Homer Simpson
one onion rings , please .	Homer Simpson
this one 's cold .	Homer Simpson
my burns have affected our ... intimacy ... because all night , i talk about how much money i 'm going to make from the lawsuit .	Homer Simpson
oh god ! it hurts worse than the burns !	Homer Simpson
well , thought bubble marge said we should put it in a college fund for lisa .	Homer Simpson
i put it in the bank . that place is great ! on their wall , they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up .	Homer Simpson
wait , the frog in the trench coat is kermit too ?	Homer Simpson
that settles it . no banks for me .	Homer Simpson
what the -- ? i 'm not gon na gamble with my daughter 's future .	Homer Simpson
a poker site is now safer than an american bank . has our nation , built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot , come to this ?	Homer Simpson
open file , click and ... invested ! hey lisa , check out your college fund !	Homer Simpson
you put my college fund on a poker site ? !	Lisa Simpson
it 's a classy operation . see , the little dealer 's wearing a bowtie . cute .	Homer Simpson

on a poker site !	Homer Simpson
more importantly it 's a college fund ...	Lisa Simpson
on a poker site !	Homer Simpson
dad , please !	Lisa Simpson
sorry . check out my new t-shirt .	Homer Simpson
where 'd you get that shirt ?	Lisa Simpson
i 've had it for a long time . i was just about to throw it out , and then this happened .	Homer Simpson
that 's one way to avoid drunk driving .	Homer Simpson
another way is do n't drink .	Marge Simpson
i 'm not superman .	Homer Simpson
homie ! do you know what yesterday was ?	Marge Simpson
ha , of course i do ! happy anni ... birth ... entine ... shark week ?	Homer Simpson
yesterday 's the day we were supposed to visit grampa !	Marge Simpson
what the ? ! stupid calendar . first you put the fourth of july on sunday , and now this ! ooh , we 're gon na discuss this later !	Homer Simpson
okay , remember the plan . apologize to grampa . then when he wants us to take him out to lunch , point to the leftovers , tell him we already did , but he forgot .	Homer Simpson
i still feel guilty . your father 's not going to be around forever .	Marge Simpson
marge , you take that back !	Homer Simpson
fine , he 'll be around forever .	Marge Simpson
you take that back !	Homer Simpson
we 're here to see abe simpson .	Homer Simpson
missing ? ! what kind of a prison are you people running here ?	Homer Simpson
there 's got ta be a clue in here somewhere . spats , sock garters , the world 's hardest hard candy ...	Marge Simpson
oh , it 's hopeless ! this room is like a museum of meaningless old crap . by which i mean every museum .	Homer Simpson
grampa 's army footlocker ! i bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box !	Marge Simpson
so precious ...	Homer Simpson
look at that , a man 's whole life being kicked around on the floor .	Homer Simpson
spiro 's ...	Marge Simpson

excuse me , have you seen this man ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm just trying to get information -- like a nosey reporter , or an undercover cop ...	Homer Simpson
or a spy from a rival gang ! hey , what are you doin ' ?	Homer Simpson

homer , she 's married to your dad !	Marge Simpson
woo hoo ! i get two christmases !	Homer Simpson
i 've read every expert on poker , and watched jennifer tilly 's dvd .	Lisa Simpson
and money is college , which should lead to more money some day , but who knows anymore ?	Lisa Simpson
i ca n't believe my dad never told me he had another wife . the man i looked up to my whole life .	Homer Simpson
you never looked up to him .	Marge Simpson
well , it 's a good thing i did n't because i 'd be pretty devastated right now .	Homer Simpson
well , we certainly do n't want to cause you any more pain .	Marge Simpson
but we need to know everything , no matter how shameful . and fast !	Homer Simpson
well just what attracted you to my father ?	Homer Simpson
that kind of romance leads to children .	Marge Simpson
i was alive when my dad knew you ?	Homer Simpson
so , this was after homer 's mother left ?	Marge Simpson
my dad had furniture ? ! i do n't know him at all !	Homer Simpson
hey , i 'm startin ' to remember why i do n't remember so much .	Homer Simpson
oh my god . i never knew the sacrifices my father made . move over , fonzie . i 've got a new hero .	Homer Simpson
but i thought you still loved him .	Marge Simpson
what does that mean ?	Marge Simpson
okay , education paid for . with a gap year , to find myself . every nerve in my body is screaming `` cash out now , '' and yet ... i 've got a pair of aces !	Lisa Simpson
full house ! aces over threes ! take that , rich-texan-oh-oh-one , and sideshow-bob-at-springfield- penitentiary . ha ! i 'm going all in !	Lisa Simpson
what ? he did n't fold ? but that 's insane unless he has ...	Lisa Simpson
four threes ? ! oh no ! no-no-no-no-no , nooooo !	Lisa Simpson

huh . `` hope . '' is this one of those coincidences like jesus on a tortilla or george washington on a dollar bill ?	Homer Simpson
well ... i like that its message is in sap and not in blood ... like some miracles i could mention . passover .	Marge Simpson
well , this is how god would send me a message . in my back yard , hammock adjacent , in one short word in large print . what do you think he 's trying to tell me , flanders ?	Homer Simpson
fine . i 'll just go eat the body of god . that 's not crazy .	Homer Simpson

to hope !	Homer Simpson
uh , excuse me , reverend , but i 'm here to talk about something a little more important : hope .	Homer Simpson

relax , kids , just be yourselves .	Marge Simpson
great , marge , now that 's in their heads .	Homer Simpson
`` star wars '' chewy 's just a man in a costume , so he 's not scary .	Homer Simpson
`` t-rex ? '' even their names are cool ! this is , umm ... ice cream , bungee jump , and ... viral video .	Homer Simpson

fine . you have a weird old version of something . let 's just watch tv .	Bart Simpson
i did n't know that was an option .	Lisa Simpson
i think i 'm done here . lisa , go nuts .	Bart Simpson
`` scientists prove cat heaven real , human heaven not '' that 's so sad ...	Marge Simpson
oh ... satire .	Marge Simpson
and these fake movie reviews are so mean , it 's hilarious .	Marge Simpson
great paper .	Marge Simpson
maggie 's a little hungry .	Marge Simpson
that 's not applesauce ...	Marge Simpson
it sure is ! there 's nothing more natural than ... that . it 's just that maggie 's already ... milked me today !	Marge Simpson
homer , i think we should go . we 're not like these people .	Marge Simpson

boo hoo hoo , you can cry all night . it 's not gon na win me back .	Homer Simpson
i can finally compost !	Lisa Simpson
maybe we should n't rush things with the new neighbors . you know , we might not all be a perfect match .	Marge Simpson
i have a plan to deal with that . step one : change everything about ourselves until we are super cool , the end .	Homer Simpson
but i always thought you were cool .	Marge Simpson
honey , i 'm not cool . i was never cool . i did n't go to college . every cd i have i bought at a carwash . black-and-white films make me angry . i ca n't pronounce `` artis-anal . '' i only know david cross from the chipmunks movie . not only do i like van halen , but i think they keep getting better ...	Homer Simpson

your father took you to a korean gangster film festival ?	Marge Simpson
yeah it was great ! this one guy was part of another guy 's gang , i mean `` kkangpae , '' but then he quit and joined another kkangpae , and when the guys in the first kkangpae found out , they were so mad they put his feet in a blender . then they cut to a guy eating noodles and blood splashed on him !	Bart Simpson
at the art walk we walked into a gallery and it was just a guy crying -- that was the art !	Lisa Simpson
the kids are a mess ! you brought them home exhausted and pretentious !	Marge Simpson

well , you wo n't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches .	Homer Simpson
and what 's with the scarf ? it 's soaked in neck sweat .	Marge Simpson
wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool . the . essence .	Homer Simpson
oh man , my goatee has barely come in . why does my hair only grow in twos ?	Homer Simpson
i hope t-rex likes the present i made him .	Homer Simpson
made ? why did n't you just buy him a toy ?	Marge Simpson
homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are . if i show up with a `` toy '' from the `` store , '' like we would give `` our kids , '' then i 've failed ! and these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing !	Homer Simpson
geez , is this a kid 's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie ?	Marge Simpson
t-rex loves decaying industrial-scapes .	Homer Simpson
come on dude , this party rocks ! love the temporary tattoo station !	Bart Simpson

holy areole ...	Marge Simpson
i 'd love to , but maggie 's a little shy ...	Marge Simpson

no one bad-mouths my dad except me !	Bart Simpson
i thought it made blimp tires !	Homer Simpson
are we still on for midnight bike riding ?	Homer Simpson
oh ohhhh boy , oh oh oh oh boy , oh boy .	Homer Simpson
have you been `` oh boy '' -ing all night ?	Bart Simpson
o-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy ... we had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors , and you had to screw it up .	Homer Simpson
look . that kid threw your present in the garbage , and he called you a poser and everyone laughed !	Bart Simpson
he called me ... a poser ?	Homer Simpson
yeah , i was sticking up for you .	Bart Simpson
you ? sticking up for your old man ? you 've never done that before .	Homer Simpson
also , i did n't want to tell you , but ... that wife and her gang looked down on me because i do n't breastfeed !	Marge Simpson
what ? no one judges my wife 's thunderbags ! well maybe i was wrong about these people . who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk ?	Homer Simpson
they can goatee ... hell !	Homer Simpson
yeah , that 's right , the friendship between the simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over !	Homer Simpson
fine . keep 'em . but you have to give back ... lisa ? !	Homer Simpson
could we at least agree to both hate flanders ?	Homer Simpson
shut up with your names !	Homer Simpson
parenting ? let me tell you `` cool parents '' something . parents are supposed to be lame ... so their kids have something to rebel against ... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame ! it 's nature 's way !	Homer Simpson
when you 're old , your tattoos will be saggy and illegible !	Marge Simpson
see , see what i 'm dealing with here , ned ? we invited them here , and they repay us with insults and judgments .	Marge Simpson
even flanders agrees ! this is our neighborhood . we were here first , so you should leave .	Homer Simpson
oh no , it 's true !	Homer Simpson
stupid town ... at least i 've still got moe 's ... although probably not , seeing where this is going ...	Homer Simpson
what happened here ?	Homer Simpson
oh , marge , it 's bad .	Homer Simpson
the cool people are everywhere ! somehow they 've even made the weather rainier !	Marge Simpson
i brought these people to springfield ... and now they 've taken over !	Homer Simpson
it 's a hellhole !	Homer Simpson
what happened to our town ? everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future !	Homer Simpson
ah relax , i 'm over it . why are n't you at the block party ?	Bart Simpson
why do you think everything 's lame ?	Bart Simpson
that 's okay , he is pretty lame . hey ... wan na watch tv ?	Bart Simpson
terrible commercials !	Bart Simpson
screw that , it 's krusty time .	Bart Simpson
okay , you win . we do n't have to be friends , but can we live on the fringes of your world ? like those eels that eat whale poop ?	Homer Simpson
c'mere , little buddy .	Marge Simpson
stop your trendy arguing ! i 'm trying to call the fire department !	Marge Simpson
your organic , all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all !	Homer Simpson
then to save us ... we need something incredibly unnatural !	Marge Simpson
fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze .	Marge Simpson
they 're necessary ! they 're necessary !	Homer Simpson
they 're finally necessary !	Homer Simpson
i guess i do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids ... except lisa . i breastfed lisa for nine months .	Marge Simpson
i did it ! i did it ! i man-hugged !	Homer Simpson

well , if i 've learned anything , it 's that you ca n't have too much iron ore .	Homer Simpson
maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry .	Marge Simpson
you 're back !	Homer Simpson
did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village ?	Marge Simpson
it 's real to them !	Homer Simpson
um ... where 's santa 's little helper ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't know -- the back yard ?	Homer Simpson

i do n't think you even like santa 's little helper !	Bart Simpson
you never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms . and i suspect you 've been chewing on his treats .	Lisa Simpson
how are they his treats if i paid for them ?	Homer Simpson
okay , okay . i 'll be nicer to the dude . i 've just never really been a dog person .	Homer Simpson
bongo ? ! i told you never to ever talk about bongo !	Homer Simpson
ever !	Homer Simpson
what just happened ? who 's bongo ?	Lisa Simpson

but i wan na know about dad and his broken heart .	Lisa Simpson
finish the damn story . i 've got a hockey game tonight .	Bart Simpson
grampa , why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that 's ever made sense ?	Lisa Simpson
it does n't make sense to me !	Homer Simpson
i happen to remember it just a little differently .	Homer Simpson
well , tell us your version .	Marge Simpson
now granted , i was just a kid , but i say ...	Homer Simpson
everything 's a flavor in the kitchens of today !	Homer Simpson
grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so i 'd never get the toy i actually wanted --	Homer Simpson
and then ... and then wha ... and then what happened ... what ... gee , my story does n't make much sense except the santa part .	Homer Simpson
yeah , but at least it was short .	Bart Simpson
wait . wait . there 's one part of the story even grampa did n't know about : a few months later , i went to rescue bongo ...	Homer Simpson
but , there was one thing i was n't prepared for ...	Homer Simpson
bongo was happy . without me . he had become her dog .	Homer Simpson
oh homie . i 'm so sorry .	Marge Simpson
well , that 's just the way dogs are . the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made .	Homer Simpson
he still has my sweatshirt .	Homer Simpson
oh my god , dad ... i owe you an apology . you saved bongo . i never understood that till now .	Homer Simpson
why would you think that , just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food ?	Homer Simpson
okay , but i 'm a little out of practice .	Homer Simpson
what flavor ?	Homer Simpson
if it does n't matter , then i call snickers .	Homer Simpson
just hug already !	Marge Simpson
homie ?	Marge Simpson
c'mon , boy . time to go to bed .	Bart Simpson
my dog .	Homer Simpson

`` learn zone ? '' mom , you said we were going someplace fun .	Bart Simpson

homer , i told you , do n't call me `` mom . ''	Marge Simpson
sorry , mrs. simpson .	Homer Simpson
this is n't the learn zone . darn it , it 's a fun place !	Marge Simpson
is this a kid you 'd pay ransom for ?	Homer Simpson
dad , what would you do if you got my ear in the mail ?	Bart Simpson
feed it to the dog .	Homer Simpson
you 'd have to wrap cheese around it .	Bart Simpson
do n't you tell me how to feed you to the dog !	Homer Simpson
where do they go ?	Marge Simpson
keep an eye on the kids , homer .	Marge Simpson
ca n't i keep an eye on that kid ? he 's fabulous .	Homer Simpson
bart and lisa .	Marge Simpson
it 's always my kids .	Homer Simpson
where 'd they go ?	Homer Simpson
almost ... holy moley ...	Homer Simpson
what the -- ? ooh , it 's hopeless .	Homer Simpson
what 's hopeless ?	Lisa Simpson
who the hell are you ?	Homer Simpson
dad ! / come up ! / pretty please ! / come up !	Bart Simpson
absolutely not ! my adult frame is simply too large . no ! never ! fine ! here i come !	Homer Simpson
crawling ... so painful ...	Homer Simpson

sh , sh . shhhhh . soon you 'll know peace .	Homer Simpson
i made it , kids ! i am king of learning-ton castle !	Homer Simpson
we tricked you ! / eat nerf , homeboy !	Bart Simpson
real matuuure !	Homer Simpson
what cool kid thing 's in here ?	Homer Simpson
calm down , everyone . calm down . i 'm sure they 'll have us out of here soon .	Marge Simpson
until then , why do n't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences .	Marge Simpson
see ? all you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation . betcha the dads are doing the same thing !	Marge Simpson
never !	Homer Simpson
butter .	Homer Simpson
apes ... deep down we 're all savage apes . leave your body , homer .	Homer Simpson
what the hell was that ?	Homer Simpson
you 've been through a traumatic experience . are you sure you wan na go to work today ?	Marge Simpson
well , i 've taken eight months off . it 's time to get back on the horse .	Homer Simpson
i guess despite all our so-called civilization , anarchy lurks around every corner , like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show .	Homer Simpson
america ca n't collapse ! we 're as powerful as ancient rome !	Homer Simpson
sweet .	Homer Simpson
oh my god ! this unsourced , undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt !	Homer Simpson
preppies ? oh , i hate you guys ! always partying on deck with your docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge !	Homer Simpson
it 's based on nothing !	Homer Simpson
i 'd slash my wrists ! but how , without my electric knife ? !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't conceive of any .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry . i am very good at keeping secrets .	Homer Simpson
impending doom ...	Homer Simpson
whatcha reading , dad ?	Lisa Simpson
honey , everything 's fine . there 's nothing to worry about .	Homer Simpson
when grownups say that , it means there is something to worry about .	Lisa Simpson
just go play your saxophone while you can .	Homer Simpson
what does that mean ?	Lisa Simpson
secrets ? i have no secrets ! just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of . smell some bread !	Homer Simpson
typical sheeple .	Homer Simpson
maybe .	Homer Simpson
yeah , but i 'll go home , weigh myself , and i 'll have gained six pounds . what 's that about ?	Homer Simpson
hey , dad . are we going camping ?	Bart Simpson
i guess an open garage is n't the best hiding place .	Homer Simpson
what 's up ? going crazy again ?	Bart Simpson
i wish . son , the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies .	Homer Simpson
so , what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon ?	Homer Simpson
guys who call themselves `` preacher '' or `` deacon '' are very bad . water is money unless gasoline is money . and even though lots of things are razor-sharp , no one ever shaves .	Bart Simpson
hollywood has taught you well , my son . now let 's push `` play . ''	Homer Simpson
fridge-ra-torr !	Homer Simpson
are n't they just saying `` refrigerator ? ''	Bart Simpson
do not question the wisdom of tom skerritt .	Homer Simpson
wow . your end of the world is better than my during the world .	Homer Simpson

it 's okay . i know what i am .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't find all our cereal , crackers , juice boxes , the butter brush ...	Marge Simpson
um ... a lot of that stuff must 've got lost in the move .	Homer Simpson
what move ? we have n't moved ! what 's going on ? !	Marge Simpson
i want to tell you but i promised to keep it a secret .	Homer Simpson
you ca n't have secrets from your wife !	Marge Simpson
it 's very late in the marriage to tell me that .	Homer Simpson
i 've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall .	Homer Simpson
i thought the basement looked cleaner .	Marge Simpson
see ? these are our bug-out bags . in here is everything we need to survive .	Homer Simpson
survive what ?	Marge Simpson
the looming kablooey .	Homer Simpson
it 's reassuring to see you 're aware of the future . but this is all a little ... creepy .	Marge Simpson
creepy ? marge , the apocalypse is coming . maybe not tomorrow , maybe never , but it 's coming ... and soon .	Homer Simpson
i 'm going to bed .	Marge Simpson
there 's no handle on this side !	Homer Simpson
the one thing i could n't prepare for .	Homer Simpson
marge , this is it ! teotwawki !	Homer Simpson
the end of the world as we know it ?	Marge Simpson

yes , sir .	Bart Simpson
society will not have to start from square one .	Homer Simpson
homie , i never thought we 'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble .	Marge Simpson
marge , when i started prepping for the end of the world , everyone laughed at me .	Homer Simpson
no one was laughing . you kept it a secret !	Marge Simpson
well , just because i imagined it does n't make it any less true . and now all those people are on their own .	Homer Simpson
how can you call yourself a christian ?	Marge Simpson
if jesus had a gun he 'd be alive today .	Homer Simpson
homer simpson ! when i fell in love with you , it was because of your big heart and your good looks . but some day those good looks are gon na fade .	Marge Simpson
i 'm proud of you . society may have crumbled , but our decency has n't .	Marge Simpson
why do we have to shoot them at all ?	Homer Simpson
no ! i want to help the people who did n't prepare !	Homer Simpson
oh god , now what ?	Bart Simpson
every time you wake us up early in the morning , it 's either church or we have to change our identities .	Lisa Simpson
do n't be silly , `` mary ellen . ''	Homer Simpson
now we 're going to leave this place . i 'm sorry , bart -- i know you 've made a bug-out camp girlfriend ...	Homer Simpson
i 've got to be honest with you . it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on .	Bart Simpson
white rice or brown ?	Homer Simpson
i never noticed .	Bart Simpson
good boy .	Marge Simpson
so we 'll take these supplies back to springfield where they 're needed most .	Homer Simpson
you 're a good man , homer simpson .	Marge Simpson
you said you cut the wires to the alarm !	Lisa Simpson
hm . i cut the wires to something .	Homer Simpson
okay , everybody , keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something . if we miss it , we 're dead .	Homer Simpson
dad , there are lights following us !	Lisa Simpson
how can that be ? i took every last can of gas !	Homer Simpson
now , everyone relax and pretend we 're about to be hit by a soft brick wall .	Homer Simpson
out of our way , corn ! the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn , corn flakes , and flash frozen corn nibblets .	Homer Simpson
now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy , starvation , and having sex for procreation .	Homer Simpson
everything 's normal . the world did n't end .	Marge Simpson
dad , you said people would be drinking each other 's blood .	Bart Simpson
you got to watch a vhs copy of `` red dawn '' thirteen times . stop complaining .	Homer Simpson
what happened with the e.m.p . ?	Lisa Simpson
are you really so disappointed the world did n't end , just so you could be proven right ?	Marge Simpson
guys , ca n't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one ? i for one am glad we 're stuck with civilization and i think we will be for a long , long time .	Lisa Simpson
we can keep the shrimp de-veiner though , right ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm afraid not .	Marge Simpson
and this goes too .	Marge Simpson
good riddance . when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol , i really lost interest .	Homer Simpson
goodbye , my electrical friends . i ca n't afford to use you , so i 'm doing what any good american would do -- throw you away .	Homer Simpson
parking meter ? !	Homer Simpson
and it still works !	Homer Simpson
this could come in handy . but let me check that list of things marge said never to bring home . dogs , cats , octopuses , octopi , octopuseseses ...	Homer Simpson
parking meter , you 're workin ' for me now .	Homer Simpson
lotta people at the dump today .	Homer Simpson

i had something better to do .	Bart Simpson
driving you crazy instead of pulling off your legs . i 've really matured .	Bart Simpson

when i think begging , i do n't imagine someone standing up .	Bart Simpson
sorry , i ca n't grant a favor to someone i do n't respect anymore .	Bart Simpson
wheee !	Bart Simpson
this is the easiest money i 've ever made , lugging around a ninety pound parking meter !	Homer Simpson

eat silver , copper !	Homer Simpson
stay with me , man . stay with me .	Homer Simpson
no , no ! you 're the first successful business i 've ever run !	Homer Simpson
it 's hopeless . i ca n't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day . i need two days !	Bart Simpson
look , the thing is , it 's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what 's on it . so , do the ones you know first . if you do n't know one , guess b and move on . now , what is the capital of massachusetts ?	Lisa Simpson
uh ... b ?	Bart Simpson
very good .	Lisa Simpson
will you stop that ? !	Bart Simpson
`` burly paper towels , burlyville , minnesota . dear sir or madam : your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels . but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three . i 'm returning the extra towel , unused ... ''	Marge Simpson

well , we 're gon na turn this change into change for the better !	Marge Simpson
woo hoo !	Homer Simpson

and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school .	Marge Simpson

`` in this exciting strategy game , you amass resources -- timber , salt fish , and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the doges of venice .	Marge Simpson

we made it , boy !	Homer Simpson
oh my god . oh my god . this counts as a walk !	Homer Simpson
the tornado took old what's-his-name ! i 'm going after him !	Homer Simpson
no , homie ! it 's too dangerous !	Marge Simpson
lenny , take us with you to find our dog ! it 's okay , marge , they 're professionals .	Homer Simpson
what , 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top ?	Marge Simpson
all right , but i 'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid .	Marge Simpson
i guess you do know your weather .	Marge Simpson
hey !	Homer Simpson
maybe the last words i 'll ever write .	Homer Simpson
aw .	Marge Simpson
maybe ! look , you guys obviously know about weather , but i understand something much more predictable : women .	Homer Simpson
what women really want is a guy who 's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she 'll still love him .	Homer Simpson
that is the stupidest ...	Homer Simpson
homer , you do not have to compete with your friends for me .	Marge Simpson
i would never do that .	Homer Simpson
enough with the singing !	Marge Simpson
fine . but i swear : i will win you back from lenny .	Homer Simpson
it 's like god 's vacuum cleaner !	Marge Simpson
help me , god ! what is it i 'm paying you for every sunday ?	Homer Simpson
can always use ... a good babysitter .	Homer Simpson
he was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy .	Homer Simpson
and here comes santa 's little helper !	Marge Simpson
homie , we made it !	Marge Simpson
are you pushing ?	Marge Simpson
yes , it wo n't give !	Homer Simpson
i do n't know if we 're gon na be able to get out . what are you writing ?	Marge Simpson
hey ! hello !	Marge Simpson
just cut the glass !	Marge Simpson
except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed , he did a pretty good job .	Marge Simpson
found another one .	Homer Simpson
it was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys .	Lisa Simpson
mom , i am so glad you 're alive .	Bart Simpson
were you worried about me , boy ?	Homer Simpson
sure , why not ?	Bart Simpson
clearly the boy 's in shock .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah , i 'm a wreck .	Bart Simpson
stop being blasã© !	Homer Simpson
never !	Bart Simpson
now i know you kids are scared by what happened , but it 's bedtime . just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes .	Homer Simpson
homie , if we did both die , we 've never named guardians . the kids could end up wards of the state .	Marge Simpson
connecticut ?	Homer Simpson
no , our state .	Marge Simpson
okay , you 're right . it 's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids , but i think the choice is obvious -- my dad .	Homer Simpson
good point . we 'll find somebody else .	Homer Simpson
i got it , dad .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah ? the tornado was more of a father to me than you ! okay , how about my brother ? he 's rich .	Homer Simpson
there 's really only one choice . or should i say two identical choices ?	Marge Simpson
oh , how very kind of you . i am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags ! one lump , please .	Homer Simpson
homer , my sisters adopted ling and she 's doing great .	Marge Simpson
that 's some impressive flute-nastics .	Homer Simpson
maybe we 'd better go .	Marge Simpson
goodbye forever !	Homer Simpson
i think it 's time to go `` off family . ''	Marge Simpson
all right , marge . maybe we 're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with . we 'll take what we can get .	Homer Simpson
uh oh . i wonder if word has gotten out that we 're looking for guardians .	Marge Simpson
where are we going ?	Lisa Simpson
and why are we wearing our good clothes ?	Bart Simpson
with nametags on them ?	Lisa Simpson
kids , there 's nothing to worry about ... but we 're looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family .	Homer Simpson
oh , i see . you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night , rolls over , and crushes mom .	Bart Simpson
this is not that ! and that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you !	Homer Simpson
homer ! dual incomes , no kids at two o'clock !	Marge Simpson
okay , i 'll nudge 'em with the car . we 'll get a whole `` meet cute '' thing going .	Homer Simpson
i think i hear a slight accent .	Marge Simpson
that 's where they filmed `` the wire '' ! step on it !	Marge Simpson
this is a pretty important decision .	Lisa Simpson
how 'bout asking that japanese guy who set the world record for eating hot dogs ? he 's like a successful version of dad .	Bart Simpson
maybe we should just give up for now , have some fried clams and collect sea glass .	Marge Simpson
wait ! what about that couple ? they look pretty cozy .	Homer Simpson
that 's moe and a bag of garbage .	Marge Simpson
whoa ! look at that guy !	Bart Simpson
wow , a man 's stomach can be flat ?	Bart Simpson
someone 's smitten .	Lisa Simpson
another surfer ?	Lisa Simpson
um ... why do n't we discuss it over dinner ?	Bart Simpson
things that you 're desperately missing from your life that you never knew you needed .	Lisa Simpson
so , surfing is really your job ?	Marge Simpson
just for standing on a thing ?	Marge Simpson
wowww . your house is perfect . no sharp corners , no unsafe balconies , a cool grampa ...	Homer Simpson
ooh , thanks , dad .	Homer Simpson
what 's that stone around your neck ?	Lisa Simpson
wow . i assumed the jackson five were the only perfect family , but now i see there 's another .	Homer Simpson
princeton , b.a. , oxford , m.a . -- i smell a rhodes .	Lisa Simpson
uh , say , listen , portia . how would you and mav feel about ... um , swinging ?	Homer Simpson
no , no , no . i meant pushing kids on swings .	Homer Simpson
okay , take whatever time you need . i just want to know if you 'd like to be their guardians .	Homer Simpson
all you need to know is i 'm a politeness monster who eats please and farts thank yous . ma'am .	Bart Simpson
i 'm exactly the kind of kid he 's pretending to be .	Lisa Simpson
man , you sure can talk surfer talk .	Homer Simpson
maybe this 'll help you make up your mind .	Homer Simpson
you never know when you might wan na mail something .	Homer Simpson
homie ... it 's been a wonderful day ... but do you think maybe we 're moving a little too quickly ?	Marge Simpson
worrywart marge . you do n't look a trojan horse in the mouth .	Homer Simpson
but we know so little about them .	Marge Simpson
i swear to you , marge , when i have the time , i will google them both .	Homer Simpson
oh , uh , well , he wanted to be here , but i 'm gon na decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you ca n't really understand what i 'm saying ...	Homer Simpson
is that arrrs or hours ?	Bart Simpson
great . and now my dad can notarize .	Homer Simpson
name another .	Homer Simpson
well , i must admit it 's a relief to get that taken care of .	Marge Simpson
now i can finally complete my bucket list .	Homer Simpson
too late ! you already signed ! oh wait , there 's one more .	Homer Simpson
suckers ! ! ! oh wait , you 've got ta initial this .	Homer Simpson
check mate .	Homer Simpson
a whole weekend ? i do n't know ...	Marge Simpson
hey , if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend .	Homer Simpson
i guess . as long as we do n't make it a habit .	Marge Simpson
marge , no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit .	Homer Simpson
do you have to do that in front of people ?	Marge Simpson
it helps me write .	Homer Simpson
marge , this has been great couples time . the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids !	Homer Simpson
well , at least we have time to get the pets ' christmas presents .	Marge Simpson
i do n't like the way they just rip the paper off . santa 's little helper my ass .	Homer Simpson
oh god ! they want to steal our kids !	Marge Simpson
no one steals my kids ... except me ... from that theme park jail ... that i never told you about ... except i guess i just did ... we 're all caught up now ... let 's go !	Homer Simpson
it all makes sense now .	Marge Simpson
that 's why they took our kids so quick .	Marge Simpson
like all childless couples , they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young .	Homer Simpson
she 's gon na raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure .	Marge Simpson
oh yeah , man .	Homer Simpson
do n't worry , marge . we 'll get 'em . unless we die on this icy mountain road . then they 've won forever .	Homer Simpson
homie , i just had a horrible thought .	Marge Simpson
women and their horrible thoughts .	Homer Simpson
what if they are better for the kids than us ?	Marge Simpson
marge , let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids . but those kids are ours , because we made them , by accident . and now , we 're gon na take them back because we love them , especially now that we 've had a little time apart from them .	Homer Simpson
i 've got a bone to pick with you ! then , an apology to make . then , we exchange insurance information . then , more bone picking !	Homer Simpson
those better be good breaks .	Homer Simpson
sure you wanted the fun parts , but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals ?	Homer Simpson
well , i 'm glad someone has .	Homer Simpson
look , before anyone says anything else , how could you possibly think you could get our kids ?	Marge Simpson
well i 'm afraid that we do n't want to be with anyone but mom and whoever she chooses to be with .	Bart Simpson
portia , you 're the woman i dream of becoming , but mom is my mom .	Lisa Simpson
we 've won . woo hoo .	Homer Simpson
kids , your father and i have decided we 're not in such a hurry to get you guardians .	Marge Simpson
instead of concentrating on dying , we 're going to concentrate on living .	Homer Simpson
if you call this living .	Bart Simpson
why you little ...	Homer Simpson
i do call this living ! living the way kids in india can only dream of !	Homer Simpson
there is nothing like your biological family .	Lisa Simpson
i win !	Homer Simpson

... but , bart , i do know this : you will not do better than mary spuckler , so do n't ignore her for a stupid video game !	Lisa Simpson
hey , relax . she knows she 's the apple of the corner of my eye .	Bart Simpson
not at all .	Bart Simpson
a lot of musical talent in this house . but no one blows on a blade of grass like you .	Bart Simpson
all eyes on you , baby .	Bart Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
well you 're gon na win , 'cause you 've got star quality . like the hulk in movies other than `` the hulk . ''	Bart Simpson
... and then i ran right home to you .	Bart Simpson
ew ! on every level ! ew ! bart , you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they 're a bunch of milhice . what ? it 's the plural of milhouse . look it up .	Lisa Simpson
listen to your sister , boy .	Homer Simpson
what i 'm saying applies to you too , dad .	Lisa Simpson
what are you talkin ' about ? marge and i are goin ' great .	Homer Simpson
homer simpson ! did you take maggie to moe 's ?	Marge Simpson
it was during happy hour . do n't you want our baby to be happy ?	Homer Simpson
do n't you see , you 're taking women for granted . and aside from being lumped together and generalized about , it 's the one thing all women hate .	Lisa Simpson
how can something that applies to bart apply to me ? i 'm so much older and wiser .	Homer Simpson
more like balder and wider .	Bart Simpson
why you little ... i 'll teach you to say something that sounds similar !	Homer Simpson
compliment her !	Lisa Simpson
i do n't know what she wants . what would my heroes say ?	Bart Simpson
it 's hard to pick just one of those .	Bart Simpson
um ... lifting people 's spirits is an interesting topic . for centuries , neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits .	Bart Simpson
mary , we 've just been through three hours of music . usually , i only have music one hour a week , and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for fire island .	Bart Simpson
mary ? are you okay ?	Bart Simpson
melvis ? where 's mary ?	Bart Simpson
am i getting dumped ?	Bart Simpson
good idea . i can chuck eggs at the other couples .	Bart Simpson
back pats ? ! this is a break up !	Bart Simpson
give me another chance . i 'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- i 'll stay down there for as long as you want .	Bart Simpson
i was the only one without a date at patty 's new lady friend 's travel bookstore soft opening !	Marge Simpson
you told me it was up to me if i wanted to go !	Homer Simpson
you should know that me saying i do n't care means i could n't care more .	Marge Simpson
i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you 're some kind of human being separate from myself ! ! !	Homer Simpson
bart , would you go to your room while your father and i finish our little talk ?	Marge Simpson
little talk ? you guys are having a big fight ! this is the problem with women ! they do n't say what they mean , until it 's too late !	Bart Simpson
all right . fine . if you boys want it , i 'll tell you what i really think .	Marge Simpson
finally , we 're gettin ' somewhere .	Homer Simpson
you 're both in the doghouse , which is misleading 'cause i still like the dog .	Marge Simpson
hand me my suitcase , boy .	Homer Simpson
when do i get a krusty suitcase ?	Bart Simpson
when you 're older .	Homer Simpson
so this is where you go when mom kicks you out ?	Bart Simpson
you 're saying it like it happens all the time . and by the way , the paint 's a little faded on my parking spot . you call this a platinum club experience ?	Homer Simpson
i 've told you a thousand times , call me homer !	Homer Simpson
what 's this notice on the wall ?	Bart Simpson
standard hotel boilerplate . it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours .	Homer Simpson
aw , man ! we just missed it .	Bart Simpson
oh , it 'll happen again , son .	Homer Simpson
um , i 've got ta make a phone call .	Bart Simpson
knock yourself out .	Homer Simpson
not again !	Homer Simpson
mary ? that 's odd , i thought i was calling the suicide not line . because i 'm doin ' great . so , um , how are you handling `` taking a break ? ''	Bart Simpson
why did i buy her that rhyming dictionary ?	Bart Simpson
i had this idea years ago ... but your mother would n't let me do it .	Homer Simpson
shows how much she ... knooooows ! it 's hurting my eyes !	Homer Simpson
you know what we need ? a classic `` kicked outta the house '' party . now who 's got a rockin ' cd ?	Homer Simpson
that 's it ? well , then let 's `` power '' this party up !	Homer Simpson
spuckler mary , please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance ...	Bart Simpson
i miss mary .	Bart Simpson
this calls for decisive action -- like l.b.j . 's use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act .	Homer Simpson
the same way hollywood does , by watching british movies !	Homer Simpson
hard to believe that country used to rule anything .	Bart Simpson
agreed , but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture .	Homer Simpson
after we finish watching the movie .	Homer Simpson
mmm ! cursive !	Marge Simpson
you are invited to ... a grand gesture ? oooh !	Marge Simpson
i wrote this song to say i 'm sorry	Homer Simpson
dad , do n't be a credit hog	Bart Simpson
the melody is by beethoven	Homer Simpson
not bad for a movie dog .	Bart Simpson
marge you will get the last pork chop ...	Homer Simpson
a completed chore list !	Marge Simpson
and i promise to do the things i checked off within a year .	Homer Simpson
but i 'm the main guy in this story ! things are supposed to work out for me !	Bart Simpson
woo hoo !	Bart Simpson
who are you ?	Bart Simpson
oh yeah !	Bart Simpson
dad , what are you watching ?	Bart Simpson
i think it 's a terence malick movie .	Homer Simpson
no , you 're watching baby poindexter , the most educational dvd available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store !	Lisa Simpson
finally , a kids ' show that is n't trying to sell you something . which reminds me , we need to order more rectangles .	Homer Simpson
do n't watch that dvd !	Marge Simpson
i threw that away because studies show it does n't do any good !	Marge Simpson
look at me !	Marge Simpson
bart ? you wanted to show me something ?	Lisa Simpson
maybe instead of watching tv with the kids , you could take them outside and ... what are you doing ?	Marge Simpson
this so-called educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it !	Marge Simpson
wait a minute . did n't bart and i both watch this thing when we were little ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm afraid so .	Marge Simpson
well , the obvious question is ... why did i turn out so ... academically superior ... while bart --	Lisa Simpson
while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way !	Marge Simpson
that 's the way people talk about ralph ! ralph , whose favorite color is peanut butter !	Bart Simpson
i wish i knew what happened ...	Marge Simpson
aooga ... aooga ... aooga ...	Bart Simpson
and now that i know better , no dvds for you kids . just educational television .	Marge Simpson
okay , no tv at all .	Marge Simpson
what ? !	Lisa Simpson
honey , this sounds like a noble experiment , but like prohibition , it will end in a hail of bullets .	Homer Simpson
fine , no tv for twenty-four hours .	Marge Simpson
twenty-four hours ? where 'd you pull that crazy number ?	Bart Simpson
we can do without tv for a day ! we 're taking maggie to a children 's bookstore , where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two .	Marge Simpson
homer , a little help ?	Marge Simpson
i 'm on it .	Homer Simpson
if i buy you , why do i need all these books ?	Homer Simpson
instead of watching tv , we can read children 's books written by tv stars !	Marge Simpson
look , maggie ! they have a story lady !	Marge Simpson
spot the hidden objects .	Homer Simpson
boy , you 're pretty pushy for a book i just met .	Homer Simpson
gotcha ! candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book ... okay , let 's see ...	Homer Simpson
have you seen lisa and maggie ?	Marge Simpson
if they 're not a trumpet or a rolling pin , then `` no . ''	Homer Simpson
homie , help me find them .	Marge Simpson
okay , now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world .	Homer Simpson
got 'em !	Homer Simpson
you 're right , i 'm bored . epoxy fight !	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , i 'll clean it up . get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors .	Bart Simpson
do n't worry , all i need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper .	Bart Simpson
all right , let 's just use a razor .	Bart Simpson
oh my god , you look just like your dad !	Bart Simpson
let 's see how far we can take this ...	Bart Simpson
and finally , the tie .	Bart Simpson
now sing the alphabet song !	Bart Simpson
what if we ... van houten to the max ?	Bart Simpson
nah . back to the sweet spot .	Bart Simpson
milhouse , if people believe you 're a grownup , we could do anything .	Bart Simpson
okay , first , tone it down . time to teach you to be a man .	Bart Simpson
nice . time for your final test .	Bart Simpson
oh great , another invasive skype from mil -- huh ?	Lisa Simpson
he 's right here .	Lisa Simpson
sure , what do i care ?	Homer Simpson
whatever you say , sir .	Homer Simpson
dad , why are you kowtowing to mr. van houten ?	Lisa Simpson
sometimes it 's just so nice to have a man take charge .	Homer Simpson
dad ? !	Lisa Simpson
grownups have their reasons !	Homer Simpson
but i just did that !	Homer Simpson
now you 're the same height as your dad .	Bart Simpson
now , did you get kirk 's license ?	Bart Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
`` kirk , '' remember you have the super-powers of a middle-aged man .	Bart Simpson
mm-hmm !	Marge Simpson
really ?	Bart Simpson
mom , i think maggie misses tv .	Lisa Simpson
you know mom , i was thinking we could take maggie downtown . `` the jazz hole '' is featuring a dizzy gillespie tribute band . their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks ...	Lisa Simpson
i do n't think so . the u.s. embassy has warned people not to go to downtown springfield .	Marge Simpson
i get it . middle child . never do what i want .	Lisa Simpson
okay , i also know of a puppet show ...	Lisa Simpson
maybe we should go .	Marge Simpson
now what are you doing ?	Marge Simpson
just one sec : nelson gave me some notes on a prank i 'm doing .	Bart Simpson
now , i asked you here because i know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city .	Bart Simpson
really ? who ?	Lisa Simpson
milhouse ?	Lisa Simpson
well , milhouse , you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they 're in no position to turn anyone away . but it does n't matter , 'cause we ca n't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway .	Lisa Simpson
au contraire , starfish hair !	Bart Simpson
the baby poindexter company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos .	Bart Simpson
they 're not gon na write a check to a couple of kids .	Lisa Simpson
thanks , but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans does n't make you man enough to be my dad .	Lisa Simpson
marge , can i get a subscription to highlights magazine ?	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's for children !	Marge Simpson
where does it say that ?	Homer Simpson
read the rest of the title !	Marge Simpson
highlights ... `` for ... ''	Homer Simpson
oh , dang it !	Marge Simpson
i lost my other earring .	Marge Simpson
leave it to me ...	Homer Simpson
earring !	Homer Simpson
... thimble from monopoly game ...	Homer Simpson
wondered where that was .	Marge Simpson
... twenty-five dollar casino chip ...	Homer Simpson
... the smallest nesting doll !	Homer Simpson
can you find anything you like in this bed ?	Marge Simpson
just my honey pie .	Homer Simpson
wan na split it while we snuggle ?	Homer Simpson
licking the wrapper .	Homer Simpson
now remember , i ca n't sit backwards or i get sick .	Lisa Simpson
well , if i look at your face , i get sick .	Bart Simpson
make me , baldy .	Bart Simpson
your intellect-deadening dvds turned my brother 's brain to jelly .	Lisa Simpson
pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody .	Bart Simpson
that 's all you pay for screwing up a child for life ?	Bart Simpson
it 's just enough to get home . i 'm hungry now .	Lisa Simpson
guys , look !	Lisa Simpson
free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch . just remember , milhouse , do not buy the condo .	Lisa Simpson
waldo . waldo . waldo .	Homer Simpson
homer , bart said the kids were going to the van houtens , but luann just told me they 're supposed to be here . they 've disappeared !	Marge Simpson
we 'll get those kids back .	Homer Simpson
because we just bought them new shoes !	Homer Simpson
waldo . waldo .	Homer Simpson
do you think lisa went to that jazz club i would n't take her to ?	Marge Simpson
how many kids will jazz corrupt ?	Homer Simpson
lady , my stomach 's full and i wan na go . that 's how it works in this country .	Bart Simpson
well , before our dad signs any contracts , he has a surprise for you ...	Lisa Simpson
kirk ? do n't you have something to tell her ?	Lisa Simpson
homie , do you see anything ?	Marge Simpson
no . i 'm sorry . it 's ... wait a minute .	Homer Simpson
we 've found what we 're looking for .	Homer Simpson
the kids ?	Marge Simpson
sure , they could be here . who knows ?	Homer Simpson
the top of your head has a five o'clock shadow .	Marge Simpson
your hair is growing back ! tell me your secret !	Homer Simpson
he 's ten years old !	Marge Simpson
there 's always a catch .	Homer Simpson
it 's gon na be `` yes , '' but do n't rush me .	Homer Simpson
son , promise you will never look like me .	Homer Simpson
i sure hope not .	Bart Simpson
why you little ! that 's not a heartwarming thing to end on !	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe you 're reading when there 's so much great stuff on tv .	Homer Simpson
hmm , you 're right . it is the golden age of well-written , brilliantly-acted tv shows .	Lisa Simpson
writing is for bathroom walls , and acting is for getting out of dui 's . the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human , made-up jobs .	Homer Simpson
ooo ! jail music !	Homer Simpson
i 'll give it one marathon .	Homer Simpson
no one feels out a unit like cj ! not bubba , not debbie and danny , no one !	Homer Simpson
high-five me , marge !	Homer Simpson
i want to know what it 's for .	Marge Simpson
too late !	Homer Simpson
we 're gon na get rich off the poor and forgetful ! and dead people .	Homer Simpson
it looks like you 're not the only predatory opportunist in town .	Lisa Simpson
there 's other p.o.s ? uh-oh , better put on my game shades .	Homer Simpson
one thousand dollars !	Homer Simpson
in the money game , cash is king .	Homer Simpson
we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes ?	Marge Simpson
you wo n't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures .	Homer Simpson
i was n't laughing -- i was being worried .	Marge Simpson
feather boas ?	Homer Simpson
mine 's full of hand mirrors .	Bart Simpson
i 've got perfume spritzers .	Lisa Simpson
makeup and baby oil !	Marge Simpson
tights ? robes ? this stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady .	Homer Simpson
property of abraham j. simpson ? this is grampa 's stuff !	Lisa Simpson
why would my man-dad have lady stuff ?	Homer Simpson
it 's not all lady stuff . look at all these fitness publications .	Marge Simpson
beefcake mags ?	Homer Simpson
i think your dad might be gay .	Marge Simpson
that 's insane ! my dad was married to a woman ... who left him ... because he ignored her needs for decades . my gay dad is gay for gays .	Homer Simpson
i think this is great ! old gay men are adorable ! like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar .	Marge Simpson
those are pretty cute ...	Homer Simpson
your dad 's been in the closet for so long , he probably does n't know how tolerant society 's become . they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year .	Marge Simpson
my dad 's always been so angry . maybe if we help him be who he is , he 'll finally be happy .	Homer Simpson
oh homie , you 're so ... enlightened .	Marge Simpson
yeah . gay rights are human rights , baby .	Homer Simpson
you sure you 're not just doing all this because it 's cool to be accepting of a gay family member ?	Bart Simpson
oh honey , that 's just silly ! this 'll show helen lovejoy , always bragging about her he-she cousin !	Marge Simpson
abe ... we found your storage locker .	Marge Simpson
it 's okay , dad . we know the truth , and we love you .	Homer Simpson
just admit who you are , and you can find new love .	Homer Simpson
if you do n't want to die alone , come out of your room !	Marge Simpson
your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you . we 've got to find him a boyfriend before it 's too late !	Marge Simpson
why do n't you put a personal ad on the internet ? that 's how young people date these days .	Lisa Simpson
it 's weird that you do n't consider yourself a young person .	Bart Simpson
i know . it 's weird to me too .	Lisa Simpson
help me out of the closet ! wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death .	Marge Simpson
no fatties !	Homer Simpson
how about some fatties ?	Marge Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
okay , post this under `` men seeking men , '' but what sub-heading ... nothing too serious ... here we go -- `` casual encounters ! '' perfect , no pressure !	Marge Simpson
i hope someone saw our ad .	Marge Simpson
if i ca n't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle , then i 've failed as a son .	Homer Simpson
someone 's coming !	Marge Simpson
grampa , you were the original bad boy !	Bart Simpson
do n't you want to be happy , abe ? admit who you are , a wonderful gay man !	Marge Simpson
then how do you explain this ?	Homer Simpson
who ?	Homer Simpson
is this true ?	Marge Simpson
look at all this wrestling stuff .	Homer Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
what 's wrong ?	Homer Simpson
i so wanted him to be gay .	Marge Simpson
thank you .	Marge Simpson
you were a world-famous wrestler ? spill the beans , old man . word beans !	Homer Simpson
those things ?	Homer Simpson
homer , do something ! they 're killing each other !	Marge Simpson
but grampa ...	Bart Simpson
i wan na hear about old-time wrestling too .	Bart Simpson
i do n't know . should i really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who 's going to ruin my future ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll bring you home my dessert .	Bart Simpson
text me the choices .	Homer Simpson
you settled that swede 's meatballs !	Bart Simpson
i ca n't wait to see grampa kick some ass ! he 's always pretended to be boring , but he 's really a straight-up psycho !	Bart Simpson
your grandfather is not psycho ! the only thing he 's `` straight-up '' is loves you .	Marge Simpson
`` gorilla joe , '' `` gorilla sam , '' `` gorilla pete , '' `` ook and eek , the gorilla twins '' ... where did mr. burns dig up all these old wrestlers ?	Lisa Simpson
apparently , old folks homes are full of people that used to be things . just like you and me . swear to god .	Homer Simpson
scorrre !	Lisa Simpson
can i have one ! can i ?	Bart Simpson
fine .	Homer Simpson
you show 'em , godfrey ! you 're the prettiest old man in the world !	Bart Simpson
why do you think bad guys are so cool ?	Lisa Simpson
why do you still have a thing for nelson ?	Bart Simpson
do not . that 's ridiculous -- it 's just -- it 's that -- he 's -- he 's a rebel and only i can change him !	Lisa Simpson
it 's so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his god-given wrestling skills . what kind of person revels in disapproval ? !	Marge Simpson
what kind of person , indeed ?	Bart Simpson
you are the luckiest people in the world ! you get to look at me !	Bart Simpson
your behavior at that game was unacceptable ! you 're lucky they gave you your participant trophy .	Marge Simpson
i got one for just watching the game .	Lisa Simpson
listen , getting people riled up is what heels do !	Bart Simpson
heel ? oh no , tell me you are not trying to be like grampa !	Homer Simpson
no i do n't . if you pray to superman .	Homer Simpson
well sure i am . i always thought grampa was lame , but he 's really awesome !	Bart Simpson
your grandfather is super lame ! i mean , if he was n't a terrible father , what 's my excuse for this ?	Homer Simpson
i know your grampa seems exciting now ... but all that preening and cheating , those turnbuckle antics are not gon na make him happy .	Marge Simpson
you grandson-ruining fiend ! look what your `` number one fan '' did at show and tell !	Homer Simpson
it 's found footage !	Homer Simpson
how are you a winner ? you 're cheating in a fake sport !	Homer Simpson
bart can not be an old-time wrestler ! as your inattentive son , and your incompetent employee , i forbid it !	Homer Simpson
why does everything i forbid always happen ?	Homer Simpson
you know it , glamorous . eye gouge , ear bite , folding chair , hair pull , face-fart , flying face-fart , and then i start fighting dirty .	Bart Simpson
i do n't care if bart is a wrestler , a busboy , or even a stoplight squeegee man ... as long as he 's a nice person .	Marge Simpson
but if he gets too much attention for acting bad , he might turn bad on the inside ...	Marge Simpson
sure , here you go .	Bart Simpson
the world is my ring now .	Bart Simpson
you all stink !	Bart Simpson
what are you doing ?	Bart Simpson
but , but , what about the cheating ?	Bart Simpson
and the preening ?	Bart Simpson
but i 'm so pretty .	Bart Simpson
why are you so mean to me ?	Lisa Simpson
he 's taking on mean man monty ! go get him , honest abe !	Homer Simpson
honest abe , can i pin him ?	Bart Simpson
they 're cheering , grampa .	Bart Simpson
oh , that was so sweet .	Marge Simpson
i wish grampa was my dad .	Homer Simpson
please let it be someone smart , motivated , and who wo n't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons .	Lisa Simpson
confident ... vassar sticker on the windshield ... could it be ... do i detect ... enthusiasm ? !	Lisa Simpson
she 's brought her own orrery !	Lisa Simpson
and it 's got no pluto ! how cutting edge !	Lisa Simpson
please-be-her ! please-be-her !	Lisa Simpson
lisa simpson , hi . as second grade student-faculty liaison , i 'd like to welcome you-	Lisa Simpson

hello , police ? i 'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress .	Homer Simpson
this room just got a whole lot cooler .	Homer Simpson
but i am playing ! i 'm hop-scotching from paragraph to paragraph , climbing the monkey bars of plot and theme .	Lisa Simpson
please keep them together ! if not for me , for the mother !	Lisa Simpson
the joeys go in feet first !	Lisa Simpson
chauncey !	Lisa Simpson
look at the size of that bird ! i 'd go henry the eighth on those drumsticks .	Homer Simpson
yeah , it 's medicinal . we had a pain in our neck .	Homer Simpson
i did n't know you were left-handed .	Homer Simpson
but the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology .	Homer Simpson
ned flanders , i ca n't believe you struck my husband .	Marge Simpson
what about christian archie comics ?	Homer Simpson

i have a bully at school .	Lisa Simpson

my bully is my teacher .	Lisa Simpson
a teacher ca n't be a bully .	Marge Simpson
we do n't have the metric system .	Lisa Simpson
we 're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher .	Marge Simpson
well , she 's just a substitute . maybe you could transfer ms. cantwell to another school .	Marge Simpson
i hate unions . there 's this guy at my plant , caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job .	Homer Simpson
homer , that 's you .	Marge Simpson
oh yeah . i say `` union '' you say `` power '' ! union ...	Homer Simpson
power .	Marge Simpson

power .	Marge Simpson
marge , you 're really dogging it on the `` power . '' but do n't worry , because of the union , you 're safe . so , just what are you gon na do for our daughter ?	Homer Simpson
we really appreciate that .	Homer Simpson
flanders ? ! how 'd you get in here ? this place is a highly-sensitive area .	Homer Simpson
hey , i do n't go to where you work and read the bible to you !	Homer Simpson
just what do you want ? !	Homer Simpson
so , you went and hired a law firm , eh ? that 's pretty aggressive .	Homer Simpson
c'mon , man . what 's the catch ?	Homer Simpson
hmm ...	Homer Simpson
i 'm not punching you , flanders .	Homer Simpson
because if i hit you back , we 'll be even . but if i do n't hit you , that makes me the better man . and i 'm liking the way that feels .	Homer Simpson
it 's not for me to judge , ned because ... i am the better man !	Homer Simpson
better man , comin ' through ... way-better-better , way-better-better zing !	Homer Simpson
you may be the sweater man , but homer is the better man .	Homer Simpson
i did n't know you were left-handed .	Homer Simpson

but why would my teacher be a bully ?	Lisa Simpson
fear not , people . i will lead you safely across .	Homer Simpson
help me , flanders !	Homer Simpson
what 's wrong , sweetie ?	Homer Simpson
my teacher 's still bullying me .	Lisa Simpson

every time i try to fix things it just makes things worse . but i 'm gon na fix this !	Homer Simpson
i think i have an idea .	Homer Simpson
flanders , i 've come to forgive you .	Homer Simpson

now do me wearing a sombrero !	Homer Simpson
now have me sleeping under a cactus !	Homer Simpson
i know this looks bad . and i admit , i would totally lie in a second to lisa or mom or dad . but i would never lie to maggie .	Bart Simpson
i did not do that prank .	Bart Simpson
wow -- he passed the maggie test . and remember how maggie solved cookiegate ?	Lisa Simpson
all too well .	Homer Simpson
to prove my brother 's innocence , i demand a youth court !	Lisa Simpson
that 's right ! bart must not be judged by these kids , but by a jury , of kids . mostly these kids . there 's only so many kids .	Lisa Simpson
son , if there 's one thing i 've learned as a defendant , and a juror , it 's ... stay out of the courtroom ! it 's so frickin ' boring ! run , boy ! i 'll create a distraction !	Homer Simpson
good news , bad news . we 're allowed to select the judge , but it 's impossible to find one who does n't hate you ...	Lisa Simpson

when god rested on the seventh day , did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed ?	Marge Simpson

just rest on the sofa , i 'll be home by ten .	Marge Simpson
can we have some candy ?	Bart Simpson
just one m & m .	Marge Simpson
then we heard a loud crash ... we were tempted to scat ...	Lisa Simpson
and we looked and we saw him ...	Bart Simpson
the fat in the hat !	Lisa Simpson
shut up .	Homer Simpson
he laughed as he heard that old codger 's house-sizzles .	Bart Simpson
say , mr. hat , i do n't mean to complain , but you promised us candy , not mayhem and pain .	Lisa Simpson
the dude thought a while , then said :	Bart Simpson
we had to escape from this behatted mammal ...	Bart Simpson
... so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel !	Lisa Simpson
a gumbamel 's a camel but faster and humbler . it does n't take tips and it 's never a grumbler . so if you must leave in a kind of a scramble , then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel .	Lisa Simpson
but if the gumbamel should ramble , then stumble , then just hop atop a krustiferous krumbull . but then if that krumbull should happen to tumble , just call your amigo , the bee man of bumble .	Bart Simpson
we thought we 'd escaped from our psychotic guide ...	Lisa Simpson
but when we got home , he was waiting inside !	Lisa Simpson
so please do not worry , 'cause we did okay .	Bart Simpson
yes , kids will get candy , whatever you say .	Bart Simpson
hey , if they get on an airbus , they know they 're taking their chances .	Bart Simpson
nowhere to tie my kite ... and i forgot my scarf .	Bart Simpson
bingo !	Bart Simpson
i 'm alive ! all patched up ! end of story .	Bart Simpson
actually , there 's a little more .	Lisa Simpson
ay carumba !	Bart Simpson
i could do what i want to bart 's head ?	Lisa Simpson
aw geez . strangle me out of this , fatso .	Bart Simpson
why you little ... i 'll teach you to make medical history !	Homer Simpson
oops .	Homer Simpson

well , my show and tell is that i 'm on lisa 's body --	Bart Simpson
/	Lisa Simpson
you 're rotating it in the wrong direction !	Lisa Simpson
well ... she 's pretty healthy for someone who 's been living with cooties .	Bart Simpson
yeah , it 's like looking down a canadian tunnel .	Bart Simpson
well , now i always have someone to eat lunch with .	Lisa Simpson
great ... oh , and i have this `` two heads for one '' coupon .	Homer Simpson
how 'bout this one ?	Homer Simpson
one random disorder free with every schizophrenia .	Homer Simpson
should 've chopped off bart 's head long ago .	Homer Simpson

rainbow ... oh , rainbow ...	Lisa Simpson
not the pony dream again !	Bart Simpson
hey , i did that !	Bart Simpson
yep , that 's me . when she 's asleep i 'm in control .	Bart Simpson
lis , i 'm gon na make sure you stay asleep .	Bart Simpson
ooh , mix-ins !	Homer Simpson
son-of-a !	Homer Simpson
now i 'll just cut off her annoying head and this body will be all mine . or we both die . not really sure what the rules are .	Bart Simpson
why bart ? i thought we were friends !	Lisa Simpson
a brother can never be friends with his sister !	Bart Simpson
are you really , really sure ?	Lisa Simpson
i 'm afraid i am .	Bart Simpson
well then , i guess i have no choice .	Lisa Simpson
'cause in a head-to-head battle , the one with the most brains wins !	Lisa Simpson
well , wherever i am , it 's got ta be an improvement .	Bart Simpson
yeah .	Bart Simpson
yeah .	Bart Simpson
i feel your pain , brother .	Lisa Simpson
help me , doctor !	Lisa Simpson
this is the song that you hear at the circus / sung by a guy that you see at the circus ...	Homer Simpson
yeah .	Bart Simpson
yeah .	Bart Simpson
mr. burnsum ! you should treat these poor people with respect !	Marge Simpson
marge ! get away from those freaks ! you belong to me ! the dumb , hairless brute !	Homer Simpson
well , you are the best this circus has to offer ...	Marge Simpson
taste the strength of your fiancã© !	Homer Simpson
with the mighty tongue god 's given you , why ca n't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels ?	Marge Simpson
marge , they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus .	Homer Simpson
i too am a freak . one eye is blue , and the other a pale brown .	Marge Simpson
never give up hope , my friends .	Marge Simpson
with an emerald that big i could buy anything -- a jalopy ! an icebox ! a steamer trunk full of fedoras ! but how do i get my hands on it ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm an idiot ! of course ! i get marge to marry moe , then i kill moe , then she gets the ring , then i marry her , and the ring is mine . and the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity !	Homer Simpson
you 're gon na be sorry you said that .	Homer Simpson
hey marge , you wan na marry moe ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm engaged to you , my love .	Marge Simpson
the poor lonely fellow is about to die .	Homer Simpson
really ? how ?	Marge Simpson
let me worry about how . but you know , you could make his last day a happy one . and the ring is just the icing on the cake .	Homer Simpson
what ring ?	Marge Simpson
the ring that 'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus . now let 's get you married .	Homer Simpson
but wo n't you be jealous , my love ?	Homer Simpson
dear , i am not the jealous type . and from you , i have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos .	Homer Simpson
awww ...	Marge Simpson
she 's a superfreak , superfreak , she 's superfreaky , yow !	Marge Simpson
moe , whatever small time together we have will be wonderful .	Marge Simpson
ho ho ho ! a very small time !	Homer Simpson
those are strange things to say , but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride 's former lover . now , the toast ...	Homer Simpson
to you , marge . now you are one of us .	Homer Simpson
one of us ! gooble goo !	Homer Simpson
what are you doing ?	Marge Simpson
trying to kill moe so we 'll get his emerald . by the way , i have n't checked , but emeralds are valuable , right ?	Homer Simpson
strong man , moe may be ugly on the outside , but inside , you are the true monster . leave my trailer forever !	Homer Simpson
you 're rejecting me ? but i 'm in the best shape anyone is , in the nineteen thirties .	Homer Simpson
i said go !	Marge Simpson
what the hell does gooble goo mean ?	Homer Simpson
you killed burnsum ? now who is gon na say `` step right up '' ?	Homer Simpson
this is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting !	Homer Simpson
... and that , kids , is how i met your mother .	Homer Simpson
poor chip . such a big part of everyone 's life .	Marge Simpson
people called him the sixth simpson . not sure why .	Homer Simpson
not me !	Marge Simpson
he 's such a little dickens . although dickens was pretty well-behaved .	Marge Simpson
i have no regrets about that . it was a perfect pregnancy . did n't smoke , did n't drink , lost three pounds . and every night before bed , homer would give me a little kiss ... music . could bart have been prenatally screwed up by the kiss music ?	Marge Simpson
get up / everybody 's gon na move their feet	Marge Simpson
get down / everybody 's gon na leave their seat	Homer Simpson
you got ta lose your mind in detroit rock city !	Marge Simpson
man , this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever .	Homer Simpson
well , for some reason it relaxes me . now do that thing gene simmons does .	Marge Simpson
overstay my welcome for forty years ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm thinking about it !	Homer Simpson
that 's the coolest bowling ball i 've ever seen .	Homer Simpson
hello , bear stearns ? i 'd like to sell all my apple stock so i can buy a fancy bowling ball . you heard me . technology is a fad . heavy blue balls are the future .	Homer Simpson
you cost me a piece of all of that !	Homer Simpson
aw , do n't cry .	Homer Simpson
i 'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all .	Homer Simpson
i 'm father o'greedy ! dimes for the needy !	Bart Simpson
my pants , like the lord , work in mysterious ways .	Bart Simpson
you misheard that on purpose !	Homer Simpson
must find way ... to blame myself .	Marge Simpson
um ... it says i should give you `` lumbar support . '' better go to the lumberyard ...	Homer Simpson
lumbar ! it means lower back . how many times will you make that mistake ?	Marge Simpson
just put on the kiss record .	Marge Simpson
anything from `` love gun '' !	Marge Simpson
hey book , are you expecting this ?	Homer Simpson
and while i 'm at it ... burn dumb helpful books !	Homer Simpson
that is a good fire .	Homer Simpson
fifty percent attention-seeking , fifty percent to drop things on people .	Bart Simpson
we 've had some good times .	Homer Simpson
and you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep . so i 'm gettin ' you shined up nice .	Homer Simpson

chief , what are you doing to save our son ?	Marge Simpson
it 's all my fault . i should never have listened to those kiss albums when i was pregnant .	Marge Simpson
really ?	Marge Simpson
can we focus on my son ? up in the sky ?	Marge Simpson
i think i just might have what you 're looking for .	Homer Simpson
today i 'm glad that i sold that stock .	Homer Simpson
why does everyone know ? !	Homer Simpson
my boy 's okay !	Homer Simpson
i won the science fair ! i get to go to chicago !	Lisa Simpson
eh , bart , bart , bart .	Lisa Simpson
you know what i think about regrets ? as long as your family is together , every choice you 've ever made is the right one .	Marge Simpson
and together we are .	Homer Simpson
now , i , bart simpson , shall send the first coaster down the track .	Bart Simpson
but milhouse , i already let you push me on the swings .	Bart Simpson
milhouse !	Bart Simpson
eat safety bar !	Bart Simpson
because your seat was behind mine !	Bart Simpson
feels like this play date 's gone on forever .	Marge Simpson
i 'll handle this . `` dear weirdo , pick up weirdo kid . '' and send .	Homer Simpson
did you eat a peanut ?	Marge Simpson
what the ? ! if this kid 's dad is n't here in one second he 's going in the garbage can .	Homer Simpson
yolo ?	Marge Simpson
once again , cats have it better .	Homer Simpson
kirk van houten , i hope you 're not having a midlife crisis .	Marge Simpson
i 'm sorry , but does kirk know how silly he looks ?	Marge Simpson
look at me , i 'm afraid of dying !	Homer Simpson
oh homie , i 'm so glad you 're happy with your life just the way it is .	Marge Simpson
you 've had the same job , same car , same house for twenty years . and that 's all you 'll ever have . a cycle you 'll never ever , ever , ever , ever , ever change . and you 're okay with it !	Marge Simpson
like i say night after night after night : nighty-night .	Marge Simpson
no dream will come true ,	Homer Simpson
you only live once .	Homer Simpson
i 'm tired of livin ' once .	Homer Simpson
i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but i 'm starting to regret saying yolo .	Marge Simpson
marge , if you do n't mind , i 'm gon na quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past .	Homer Simpson
postage , marked in pesetas ? who are those letters from ?	Marge Simpson
my old pen pal from spain . eduardo .	Homer Simpson
back in fifth grade , you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner . i picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast . we 'd write each other with our dreams of the future ...	Homer Simpson
i was gon na be king of cheeseburger mountain . did i change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers ? probably a little bit of both .	Homer Simpson
so sad .	Homer Simpson
i have a solution !	Lisa Simpson
maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat .	Lisa Simpson
what i 'm suggesting is we create an honor code .	Lisa Simpson
the students would do it .	Lisa Simpson
if every student pledges not to cheat , and to turn in any cheater , no one will cheat the system because they 'll be the system .	Lisa Simpson
if you 're my wife 's secret lover , come in . there 's nothing i can do for her anymore .	Homer Simpson
eduardo ? ! is it really you ? why are you here ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm homer simpson !	Homer Simpson
i wish .	Homer Simpson
marge simpson ! it 's so nice to meet a friend homer met through the mail who is n't a sea monkey !	Marge Simpson
homie , i thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up .	Marge Simpson
what happened to us , eduardo ? we had so many things we were going to do .	Homer Simpson
yeah , well listen , pal . i have my treasure : my wife and my children .	Homer Simpson
ooh !	Marge Simpson
do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name ?	Homer Simpson
hey , homer . did you just fart ?	Bart Simpson
did you just fart , sir .	Homer Simpson
whatever .	Bart Simpson
really ? now ? i have two pizzas coming . i wanted to see who would get here first .	Homer Simpson
i asked him here to cheer you up , but i did n't think you 'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some , no offense , spaniard .	Marge Simpson
i 'm not used to strange men saying the word `` bedroom '' around me .	Marge Simpson
that 's even worse . could you say it one more time ?	Marge Simpson
ooh !	Marge Simpson
hello , children . i hold before you a copy of the school 's new honor code .	Lisa Simpson
i know if i can get the toughest kid in class to sign it , the rest of you will sign it . milhouse ?	Lisa Simpson
now , the smartest kid . milhouse ?	Lisa Simpson
now the class nerd . milhouse ?	Lisa Simpson
why are you doing this ? wait . are you in love with me ?	Homer Simpson
woo-hoo ! i 'm an attractive concept like liberty !	Homer Simpson
one more ride ?	Homer Simpson
how much did this cost to restage ?	Bart Simpson
they rented everything from comic book guy for ten bucks .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled , but i feel great .	Homer Simpson
if you 're happy i 'm happy .	Marge Simpson
that does n't sound happy .	Homer Simpson
i feel kind of ... melancholy ...	Marge Simpson
mmm , melon collie .	Homer Simpson
that 's not helping .	Marge Simpson
well , what was your childhood dream ?	Homer Simpson
jumping on the bed . but i never disobeyed my parents , till i married you .	Marge Simpson
let 's do it .	Homer Simpson
i 'm a little tired . could we just snuggle again ?	Marge Simpson
we do that every night ! come on ! jump on the bed !	Homer Simpson

so that 's it ? all my dreams , lived ?	Homer Simpson
well , we 've got ta do it ! i never leave a job unfinished . it 's as true now as that week i worked on the high school yearbook . so much infighting . i had to get outta there !	Homer Simpson
the editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend .	Homer Simpson
um , actually , my hero was the actress who provided rocky 's voice , june foray . a true legend in the voiceover community . i 'm just gon na stay on the plane and think about her influence .	Homer Simpson
i guess i 'll be getting some extra credit for this .	Lisa Simpson
no , this is good .	Lisa Simpson
okay .	Homer Simpson
i got bart 's backpack .	Lisa Simpson
he got a hundred on his test ? ! that 's impossible !	Lisa Simpson
is bart cheating ?	Lisa Simpson
are the pope 's tweets infallible ?	Bart Simpson
bart ! i 'm gon na tell !	Lisa Simpson
no , you 're not . because if you tell people i cheated , that means your system failed .	Bart Simpson
oh my god , you found a loophole ! why do n't you just put this much inventiveness into your work ?	Lisa Simpson
because then i 'd be the one thing i swore i would n't : you .	Bart Simpson
i 'm doing it ! i 'm flying like the squirrel i always knew i was .	Homer Simpson
ooh , indigo !	Homer Simpson
homer !	Marge Simpson
it 's me , talking in your earphone !	Marge Simpson
come down , homie ! `` you only live once '' also means when you die , you die !	Marge Simpson

majestic eagle ... just like me , unashamed of his baldness .	Homer Simpson
so beautiful .	Homer Simpson
aw , he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half .	Homer Simpson
stupid tallest building in springfield !	Homer Simpson
you 've presented me with quite a conundrum .	Lisa Simpson
a word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced .	Lisa Simpson
but after some thought , all my worries went away .	Lisa Simpson
i know the answer . i 'm gon na force you to turn yourself in .	Lisa Simpson
good luck with that . the only thing that 'll change my mind is a sign from god .	Bart Simpson
son , it was so beautiful ! i went faster than the speed of sound .	Homer Simpson
well bart , is that enough of a sign for ya ?	Lisa Simpson
all right , i 'll turn myself in . it 'll give me a chance to work some more on the detention quilt .	Bart Simpson
no matter what , homer simpson has done it . and soon i hope i remember who homer simpson is and his relationship to me . but i have no regrets . in fact , all this has given me a sense of calm i 've never had before .	Homer Simpson
can you give me the morphine forever ?	Homer Simpson
eduardo ? eduardo ! eduardo !	Homer Simpson
oh . it was all just a dream .	Homer Simpson
oh yeah . great . um ... do i drop you at the curb or do i have to park and walk you in ?	Homer Simpson

that 's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me .	Homer Simpson
hey , what 's this marching band have to do with homer junior ? what ? there were cheerleaders in our house ? and nobody told me ?	Homer Simpson
one is the loneliest number that you 'll ever do ...	Lisa Simpson
two can be as bad as one / it 's the loneliest number since the number one ...	Lisa Simpson
no is the saddest experience you 'll ever know / yes , it 's the saddest experience you 'll ever know ...	Lisa Simpson
'cause one is the loneliest number that you 'll ever do / one is the loneliest number , worse than two ... and one -- you know , i really think i 've made the point .	Lisa Simpson
a spitwad ?	Lisa Simpson
well , at least i 'm getting some attention .	Lisa Simpson

let me ? uh , sweetheart , i downloaded it off the internet ... illegally .	Homer Simpson
an illegal download ? but hollywood says stealing from hollywood is wrong .	Marge Simpson
why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the air buds and ray liottas of the world ?	Homer Simpson
when i watched that pirated movie , i was stealing with my eyes . so i 'm repaying the good people in hollywood for the ticket i should have bought .	Marge Simpson
now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen .	Marge Simpson

movie piracy .	Homer Simpson

it 's almost like having dad here . only with less growling when i go near his food .	Lisa Simpson
i just want to know who dropped the dime on dad . lousy rat .	Bart Simpson
maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing .	Marge Simpson
homer just pirated a movie . it 's not the worst thing dad ever did . it 's not even the worst kind of pirate dad 's ever been .	Bart Simpson
lisa , tell your brother that stealing is wrong , no matter what .	Marge Simpson
i do n't know . it was n't like dad was stealing for himself . he created this wonderful experience for the whole town . i just ca n't imagine anyone turning him in .	Lisa Simpson

homer ! what are you doing out of prison ? you have to go back and give yourself up .	Marge Simpson

wait , i know one place in springfield that does n't care about internet piracy laws .	Lisa Simpson
thanks for taking us in . our family always appreciates asylum .	Lisa Simpson
your country does n't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong .	Marge Simpson
the people of sweden believe all movies should be shared freely .	Lisa Simpson
how is that not stealing ?	Marge Simpson
yeah , and why do n't they make a sequel to `` taken '' where the `` hangover '' guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is `` fast and furious . ''	Homer Simpson
oh man , i would love to pirate that .	Bart Simpson
they 've found us !	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy .	Marge Simpson

it was me ! i was the one who told the fbi .	Marge Simpson
you ? how could you ? you 're my own flesh and blood !	Homer Simpson
i was just trying to do the right thing ! who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me ?	Marge Simpson
have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish , to aid and abet ?	Homer Simpson
i never wanted to say funny vows !	Marge Simpson
well you did . and they got laughs . solid laughs .	Homer Simpson
i did n't mean for this to happen , but ... you were stealing .	Marge Simpson
all i ever had was you looking out for me . i 've got nothin ' now .	Homer Simpson
so ... everyone 's a pirate ?	Bart Simpson
no .	Homer Simpson
homer , tell them your side of the story . i know i hurt you , but please trust me now . it 'll work .	Marge Simpson
you know what , judge apatow ... i do have something to say . these movie people may say i 'm a pirate . but i 'm just a man . a man who loved hollywood too much . so i made my own rules , and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life .	Homer Simpson
at first my wife did n't believe in me . maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place .	Homer Simpson
but when times seemed darkest , one minute ago , she was there , and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what i believe in .	Homer Simpson
one family , against all odds , took on the system ... and lost .	Homer Simpson
i 'd be jaden !	Bart Simpson
these people hate my dad . how can they want to make a movie about him ?	Lisa Simpson
and the worst one of all is --	Lisa Simpson
i 'll sign with whoever can convince channing tatum to gain the most weight to play me .	Homer Simpson
what the hell is all this ? !	Homer Simpson
but the movie is n't in theaters till next week .	Marge Simpson
you 're pirating my movie ?	Homer Simpson
the hell you are ! piracy is stealing ! you 're taking money out of my family 's mouths .	Homer Simpson
oh that 's hollywood fantasy . we live in the real world , where i have something called `` prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion '' .	Homer Simpson
homie ...	Marge Simpson
now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens ! no bargain matinees !	Homer Simpson
and tell your friends it was great ! buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it .	Homer Simpson
homer in the movie wears ask body spray and so should you . do n't ask ! do smell !	Homer Simpson
homie , do you really think you should be --	Marge Simpson
up bup bup bup bup ! what have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband ?	Homer Simpson
ask body spray !	Marge Simpson
so what do you think , lis ? who are the good guys here , the media companies or the internet freedom guys ?	Bart Simpson
well , both groups claim their intentions are noble , but at the end of the day , they 're both trying to steal as much money as they can .	Lisa Simpson
they killed off radioactive man ? ! i did not see that coming . die carumba .	Bart Simpson
they 'll just reboot radioactive man in an overpriced new origin issue and get clueless fanboys like you to line up at midnight to buy them .	Lisa Simpson
homer !	Bart Simpson

because you 're so drunk you can barely keep it together !	Homer Simpson
i was n't drinking . i was learning that nature is n't a complete waste of space .	Bart Simpson
that does n't sound like you .	Lisa Simpson

fine ! but the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it .	Homer Simpson
look , the eagles and the falcons . tell me you 're not interested in that .	Homer Simpson
i could fly too if i did n't have a wife and three kids !	Homer Simpson

i knew you 'd escape ! were you carried out by a flock of falcons ?	Bart Simpson
were falcons involved in any way ?	Bart Simpson
great . before anything else , let me just get closer to the door and say `` how crazy are you '' ?	Bart Simpson
no offense , but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy , it 's not funny .	Bart Simpson

what are you doing ?	Bart Simpson

i did n't mind that he grew bald ... i did n't mind that he got fat ... i did n't mind that he got fatter . but no one told me he 'd get older than me .	Marge Simpson

maybe i should get that sick one . if i do n't , no one else will . bart , list your top five , best to worst . no , no , no , no -- worst to best !	Lisa Simpson
i just wish the grey one had the brown one 's personality !	Lisa Simpson
dad , give me your phone . i need to look at the pictures again !	Lisa Simpson
okay , this is the guinea pig that will make me happy .	Lisa Simpson
she thinks she 's decided . do n't say a thing . do n't blow this !	Homer Simpson
i could get two ... ?	Lisa Simpson
fighting tweakers rule !	Homer Simpson
i 've tried to give pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat :	Lisa Simpson
peruvian feather grass , an incan sleeping mat , and a portrait of marisol espinoza , the vice president of peru .	Lisa Simpson
are you sure you did n't create a perfect habitat for you ?	Bart Simpson
i wish i could live in there .	Lisa Simpson
well there 's plenty of room ... because pokey 's gone .	Bart Simpson
where 'd he go ?	Lisa Simpson
this looks like a job for ... fireplace tongs .	Bart Simpson
nooooo !	Lisa Simpson
oh my god , he 's in the walls !	Lisa Simpson
i hear chewing !	Lisa Simpson
no , that 's a much bigger animal .	Bart Simpson
kettle corn ... the heroin of the farmer 's market .	Homer Simpson
i 've lost my guinea pig !	Lisa Simpson
pokey !	Lisa Simpson
that 's okay sweetheart . your pig thingy did n't mean it . it 's just ... it felt comforting to know that while we watched tv , there was art going on behind us .	Marge Simpson
well , i guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting .	Marge Simpson
sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money . or ...	Homer Simpson
yeah , these seem great . oh , too bad someone used cello rosin .	Homer Simpson
oh my gosh , that 's beautiful ! i 've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before .	Marge Simpson
this could be our new living room painting !	Marge Simpson
i do n't know . how 'bout this poster of a really rockin ' jukebox ?	Homer Simpson
you know it 's rockin ' 'cause music notes are coming out of it .	Homer Simpson
oh please , homie ...	Marge Simpson
oh , it looks great !	Marge Simpson
well , to me , it looks like ... garbage salad , but that 's the great thing about art : everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks .	Homer Simpson
i 've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from kirk 's bachelor bad . i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected .	Marge Simpson
hey , look ... there 's a signature that the frame covered up : `` johan oldenveldt . ''	Lisa Simpson
here he is ! `` johan oldenveldt , painter , lived in amsterdam , paris ... prolific early 20th century naturalist ... i think this was painted by someone famous . maybe it 's valuable .	Lisa Simpson
we should have it appraised !	Marge Simpson
you guys are crazy . i 've never even heard of that guy . it 's not like it was painted by leonardo da vinci code .	Homer Simpson
now , ere 's what makes art valuable : 1. nudity . 2. holograms . 3. something terrible happening to jesus .	Homer Simpson
oh my god !	Marge Simpson
nobody touch it ! bart , stop looking at it !	Homer Simpson
but i want to see it !	Bart Simpson
no , you 'll wear it out !	Homer Simpson
baby , you saw something in this painting , and you were right .	Homer Simpson
wow , the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth . think how happy they 'll be when we sell it and split the money with them .	Marge Simpson
split it ? whoa . whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ...	Homer Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ...	Homer Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa ...	Homer Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa ...	Homer Simpson
whoa ! whoa ! whoa !	Homer Simpson
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ... split it with them ?	Homer Simpson
kirk and luann did n't know what the painting was worth when they sold it .	Marge Simpson
yes , they sold it to us . so now it 's our painting . we can hang it on our wall , cut eyeholes in it to spy on people , or ... sell it for lots of money which we keep .	Homer Simpson
for ourselves ?	Bart Simpson
this dude gets it .	Homer Simpson
but the van houtens are our friends !	Marge Simpson
i do n't know what you 're talking about . hide the treasure !	Homer Simpson
are they , marge ? if you think about it , are n't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid ?	Homer Simpson
all our friends are like that !	Marge Simpson
well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable ?	Marge Simpson
i would feel : a ) . happy for their good fortune , b ) . proud to know rich people , and c ) . grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake .	Homer Simpson
how about this ... what if we give the van houtens twenty-five percent of the money ?	Marge Simpson
then they 'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we 're keeping !	Homer Simpson
marge , you like kindness , right ?	Homer Simpson
sure .	Marge Simpson
so even if we gave kirk and luann some of money , the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them , like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti .	Homer Simpson
homer looks into marge 's eyes .	Homer Simpson
it 's kinder never to tell them .	Homer Simpson
okay ... i see your point . we should sell the painting , keep all the money , and never , ever tell the van houtens .	Marge Simpson
what 'll it take to buy your silence ?	Homer Simpson
okay milhouse , the guys in back are putting your new bike together .	Homer Simpson
oh sweetie , you want your parents to be happy , do n't you ?	Marge Simpson
i guess . you 're funny ! no wonder lisa 's in love with you .	Homer Simpson
she is ?	Lisa Simpson
you got it , ceej .	Bart Simpson
we had a deal . and now we 've got nothing ...	Homer Simpson
if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing , how could you live with yourselves ? we were just trying to be ... kind .	Marge Simpson
we were gon na treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why , but now forget it !	Homer Simpson
that 's exactly how it is .	Homer Simpson
oh it is .	Homer Simpson
luann , i hope we 're still on thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops .	Marge Simpson
oh , that was cold , luann . so cold ! brrrrr ! sarcastic brrrrrr !	Homer Simpson
see what happens when we get greedy ?	Marge Simpson
honey , there 's something i wan na show you .	Homer Simpson
an atm receipt ?	Marge Simpson
i do n't know whose this is . i found it next to the cash machine , and i 've always kept it . look at the balance .	Homer Simpson
five figures !	Marge Simpson
with that painting we could have what these people have . a money cushion . no more living paycheck to paycheck , one lost retainer away from the gutter .	Homer Simpson
i could write a check with ... today 's date on it .	Marge Simpson
that 's the cushion .	Homer Simpson
great ! now we 're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world !	Marge Simpson
do n't worry . no one 's gon na see this stupid show .	Homer Simpson
give back the painting ! the whole town 's turned against us !	Marge Simpson
`` you have no obligation to share the money from that painting . '' ooo , a support rock !	Homer Simpson
this one 's against us . this one 's for us . for , for , against , for , against ...	Bart Simpson
we do n't even get this many christmas cards .	Marge Simpson
you really think we 're still doing the right thing ?	Marge Simpson
just close your eyes and think of the cushion .	Homer Simpson
the paddles , marge ! look at the paddles !	Homer Simpson
our cushion !	Homer Simpson
see what your greed has done ?	Marge Simpson
excuse me , we 're trying to find `` cafã© artiste . ''	Homer Simpson
i guess i ca n't help but feel fully responsible .	Homer Simpson
what you need , my friend , is a canadian duff . beauty , eh ?	Homer Simpson
so , why does that chick think she owns the painting ?	Homer Simpson
not your fault , man . those parasailing guys take whatever they want .	Homer Simpson
okay , all i got ta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde , find cafã© artiste , and they 'll back up kirk 's story . that will prove the painting was his -- and now ours .	Homer Simpson
oh , homer simpson , that painting has torn the town apart , destroyed kirk and luann 's marriage , and everyone 's very worried about milhouse .	Marge Simpson
he 's been playing dancing revolution for hours , but the tv is off .	Bart Simpson
but our cushion ...	Homer Simpson
that picture has brought out the worst in everyone ! please ... just let it go !	Marge Simpson
you 're not gon na let it go , are you ?	Bart Simpson
i wish i knew how .	Homer Simpson
this is so exciting ! my first time establishing provenance !	Lisa Simpson
yeah , yeah , yeah . just remember , if your mother asks , i took you to a wine tasting .	Homer Simpson
that 's a terrible thing for a father to do .	Lisa Simpson
that 's why she 'll believe it .	Homer Simpson
hmm ... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy .	Lisa Simpson
sounds delicious . it 's not . hey , a friend of mine , uh , bought a painting here .	Homer Simpson
and that man sold it to me !	Homer Simpson
that proves the painting is mine ! and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money !	Homer Simpson
i love art !	Homer Simpson
yes we do . it 's a johan oldenveldt .	Lisa Simpson
what ?	Lisa Simpson
who ?	Homer Simpson
prove it .	Homer Simpson
oh ... crap .	Homer Simpson
you 're a ... forger ?	Lisa Simpson
then why did the auction house say it was real ?	Homer Simpson
what you do is horrible : ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles .	Lisa Simpson
what ! ?	Lisa Simpson
now let 's play human foosball !	Homer Simpson
well ... no , but now when i look at it all i 'll see is a fraud .	Lisa Simpson
but , you still , i mean ... i suppose you 're right .	Lisa Simpson
what if i never liked the painting , and only wanted it for money ?	Homer Simpson
oh , great . the painting is worthless ... this was all for nothing . and when marge finds out she 's gon na kill me .	Homer Simpson
while you 're at it ... could you make me a couple more ?	Homer Simpson
i 'll pay you in strupo ...	Homer Simpson
oh , perfect . now that 's art .	Marge Simpson
rockin '	Homer Simpson
end this madness !	Bart Simpson
what makes you a hero ?	Bart Simpson
madame curie , we just might have this one in the bag .	Lisa Simpson
okay , calm down . maybe he 's talking about margaret mead .	Lisa Simpson
no-no-no .	Lisa Simpson
martin took my topic . what do i do ?	Lisa Simpson
oh , just make a speech about dad .	Bart Simpson
everyone does that .	Lisa Simpson
everyone does that with good dads . but with our dad , it 's like climbing mount everest . you either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever . either way , hell of a show .	Bart Simpson
okay , dad 's my hero . why is he my hero ?	Lisa Simpson
marge , it happened again !	Homer Simpson
near tears .	Lisa Simpson
no !	Lisa Simpson
my hero is n't famous ...	Lisa Simpson
loser .	Homer Simpson
... is n't rich ...	Lisa Simpson
pathetic .	Homer Simpson
... and is n't in any history books ...	Lisa Simpson
he makes me sick .	Homer Simpson
he 's my dad .	Lisa Simpson
he worked two jobs to get me a pony ... he started me playing the saxophone you all love ...	Lisa Simpson
... and anyone can put a band aid on , but my dad knows how to take it off so it does n't hurt .	Lisa Simpson
the trick is , wait several weeks .	Homer Simpson
... and when my dad was a soccer referee , he had the guts to red card me , his only talking daughter , because he knew i was diving .	Lisa Simpson
in the history of soccer , he 's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid , and he was right . he made me a better person , because that 's what heroes do .	Lisa Simpson
that 's what heroes do .	Lisa Simpson
i 'm so glad i was forced to come .	Homer Simpson
'cause i 'm a grade school hero / lisa never lies / i 'm a grade school hero / and heroes never die / just one guitar ! slung way down low / yeah one guitar ! / where did my lawnmower go ? !	Homer Simpson
hey , dad .	Lisa Simpson
lisa , your speech was one of the nicest things anyone 's ever done for me .	Homer Simpson
when did you come up with the idea ? you must 've worked on it for days .	Homer Simpson
oh , dad , you do n't want details . no one wants to see the sausage being made .	Lisa Simpson
there 's sausage being made ? where ?	Homer Simpson
homie , there 's someone here to see you .	Marge Simpson
coming ! i have n't forgotten about the sausage .	Homer Simpson
ooh !	Homer Simpson
oh yeah . that 's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years .	Homer Simpson
of course i am , but how do you know ?	Homer Simpson
much better .	Homer Simpson
well , no one has ever has questioned my professionalism . except at my profession .	Homer Simpson
what do you think , sweetie ?	Homer Simpson
dad , they 're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth !	Lisa Simpson
the two thousand eight super bowl ?	Homer Simpson
it 's okay . i 'm an american !	Homer Simpson
sure , why not ?	Homer Simpson
`` congratulations on your purchase of a footmaster brand soccer ball . '' thanks , book !	Homer Simpson
look , you got us a free trip . just slack off and cash your check like you always do .	Bart Simpson
i believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one d would disagree with you .	Homer Simpson
what the ? !	Homer Simpson
i switched with her , dad .	Lisa Simpson
look at you , using approved electronic devices .	Homer Simpson
to try to avoid any misunderstandings in brazil , like we had the last time , i 'm learning the language .	Marge Simpson

eu gostaria de um ... hang on , hang on ... placa de ... hang on , hang on ...	Marge Simpson

how 'd you eat the meat without the vegetables ?	Lisa Simpson
the stomach wants what it wants . i need some air .	Homer Simpson
ah , brazil . i could n't stay afraid of you forever . the only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream . that is a deal breaker .	Homer Simpson
thanks . i still ca n't believe the yellow and red cards do n't stand for mustard and ketchup .	Homer Simpson
you do n't know the new me of the last few days at all !	Homer Simpson
red card !	Homer Simpson
get outta here !	Homer Simpson
man , krusty should get some of these letters .	Bart Simpson
while you were out , the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts , a chocolate bowling ball , and a fresh pork sandwich .	Bart Simpson
how fresh ?	Homer Simpson
where 's your mother ?	Homer Simpson
went to practice her portuguese .	Bart Simpson
`` selecionar conta ... '' ooh , `` select account '' !	Marge Simpson
i did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so i could use the english option .	Marge Simpson
you know , you 're pretty rude .	Marge Simpson
give the donuts to the hotel staff . release the pig , and the bowling ball , into the wild .	Homer Simpson
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?	Bart Simpson
yes . but knowing that lisa chose me as her hero ... without ever considering any other hero ... keeps me strong .	Homer Simpson
why so quiet ?	Homer Simpson
i 'm just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever . eh , why not ?	Bart Simpson
i 'm listening . and it better be devastating .	Homer Simpson
you were n't lisa 's hero . she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero .	Bart Simpson
oh my god . that 's , that 's shattering . and now , i 'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since san francisco turned all nerdy .	Homer Simpson
where are you going ?	Bart Simpson
to drink until there 's no pain left in my soul . but first i 'm gon na eat off someone else 's room service tray that was left in the hall !	Homer Simpson
now that 's a broken man .	Bart Simpson
fine . marge is always complaining i never fix things . give me another .	Homer Simpson
i carry my own .	Homer Simpson
if i bet it , i could double it . but on who ?	Homer Simpson
thanks for telling me . i was gon na tape it .	Homer Simpson
wave a brazilian flag so you 'll stand out in the crowd .	Homer Simpson
do n't do it , dad . do n't cheat .	Lisa Simpson
you 're a funny one to tell me about deception .	Homer Simpson
i 'm sorry you were n't my first choice . in fact ... i had my doubts about using you at all .	Lisa Simpson
well , if we 're going to be brutally honest , that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness .	Homer Simpson
you put it on the fridge !	Lisa Simpson
it was pity-fridged !	Homer Simpson
all right , you 're hurt . i understand . but when i made you my hero , you lived up to it and more . you became the hero i thought you could be , dad .	Lisa Simpson
oh , come here .	Homer Simpson
everything 's right with the world .	Homer Simpson
that 's all right , brain . if i die , i 'll be doing the thing i love the most : trying not to get killed .	Homer Simpson
no penalty ! he dove , dad !	Lisa Simpson
no penalty !	Homer Simpson
i repeat , no penalty !	Homer Simpson
no penalty !	Homer Simpson
well , at least i 'll die the american way . in a foreign country wearing short pants .	Homer Simpson
wait , wait , wait , wait ! i wan na say something !	Marge Simpson
um ... deixar meu marido sozinho !	Marge Simpson
how 's she doin ' that ?	Bart Simpson
i do n't know , but she 's my new hero .	Lisa Simpson

first , mazel tov ! second , do n't ! please , please , i 'm a mother . surely you have a mother too .	Marge Simpson

hey ! look at me ! i 'm going up a slide !	Homer Simpson

oh , are the kids with you ?	Homer Simpson
hi , dad ! / homer .	Bart Simpson

i saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gon na hide out on top of mount springfield .	Bart Simpson
we outlaws have to stick together .	Bart Simpson
stolen bowling shoes , 3-d glasses , krusty standee ... and this `` cage '' for my pet .	Bart Simpson

i wo n't be using the correct term then .	Lisa Simpson
um , why do n't i just go sit alone and -- oh , you 're doing it .	Lisa Simpson
maybe this is n't the sport for you .	Lisa Simpson
can i join you for lunch ?	Lisa Simpson
um , can i just have a slice ?	Lisa Simpson
whoa .	Bart Simpson
it 's the first i 've seen it .	Bart Simpson
i have a feeling this playstadium was `` liberated '' from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude .	Bart Simpson
you ca n't spell `` crime '' without `` me . ''	Bart Simpson
lucas .	Marge Simpson
competitive eater ? did i hear right ? i could be a competitive eater ?	Homer Simpson
no ! you did n't hear anything !	Marge Simpson
yes i did ! i heard `` competitive eater '' !	Homer Simpson
it 's for people who have n't had heart problems !	Marge Simpson

quit comparing me to ben chapman !	Marge Simpson
i will when you open your mind to change !	Homer Simpson
beans , beans . we 'll do beans .	Lisa Simpson

you seem stressed .	Bart Simpson
you wan na suck some squishee ?	Bart Simpson
careful . it 's uncut syrup . they give it to horses before they race .	Bart Simpson
you ratted him out ? he 's got a kid !	Bart Simpson
so you see , we ca n't let jailbird fry .	Bart Simpson

oh , there 's my magazine . why , look at this ! `` what every father should do for his daughter . ''	Marge Simpson
marge , if you want me to do something , just tell me . do n't hide behind a magazine .	Homer Simpson
right , right , right , right . according to judy kleinsmith , a professional freelance writer , fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would . then she 'll expect the same from the men in her future !	Marge Simpson
wait . let me get this straight . sit and eat ? that 's my punishment ?	Homer Simpson
it 's not a punishment . but you ca n't just eat dinner . you have to be gentlemanly and attentive .	Marge Simpson
oh , i can fake attentive . i 've been watching a football game this whole discussion .	Homer Simpson

okay , okay . we 'll make it fun . i 'll take her to that crab place . all the crabs you could smash .	Homer Simpson

she might marry someone like me ? you think that would be bad ! ?	Homer Simpson
homie , i love you . but you can be a challenge , like doing the daily jumble .	Marge Simpson
marge , you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper !	Homer Simpson
well , i was just trying to --	Marge Simpson
i 'm sleeping on flanders ' couch tonight . ours is crap .	Homer Simpson
... so marge says i got ta `` ask lisa on a date . ''	Homer Simpson

i did n't mean to make her pregnant . i just hate art so much .	Bart Simpson

you will not sing unless there 's a sing-along , and never take the tray out of the caterer 's hand .	Marge Simpson
do n't be too loud and do n't be too quiet . when you 're too quiet , you get that psycho look .	Marge Simpson
and stay in the living room . do n't go to their kids ' room and watch a basketball game .	Marge Simpson
